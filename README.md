# Reddit Web Scraping
Reddit Web Scraping is a project aimed at extracting data from Reddit using web scraping techniques. It involves accessing Reddit's public data through its web interface, extracting specific information from Reddit posts, and saving the data for further analysis or processing.

##Introduction
Reddit is a popular social news aggregation and discussion platform where registered members can submit content, such as text posts or direct links. This project demonstrates how to extract data from Reddit using Python and the BeautifulSoup library, focusing on retrieving information from Reddit posts, including titles, URLs, and comments.

## Files
Reddit_web_scrap.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for web scraping Reddit and saving the extracted data.
output.csv: CSV file containing the scraped data, including post titles, URLs, and comments.
## Dependencies
+ Python 3.12.0
- Jupyter Notebook
+ BeautifulSoup library
## Usage
Open Reddit_web_scrap.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the code cells.
After running the code, the extracted data will be saved to output.csv in the same directory.
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd

# Load the scraped data from output.csv
reddit_data = pd.read_csv('output.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
print(reddit_data.head())
Data Format
The extracted data is saved in a CSV format with the following columns:

Title: Title of the Reddit post.
URL: URL of the Reddit post.
Comments: Number of comments on the Reddit post.
## Future Improvements
Implement error handling and robustness in web scraping code.
Explore additional data attributes available in Reddit posts for extraction.
Develop a more interactive and user-friendly interface for data retrieval
