Scraping Google Search results (on a small scale),"I'm working on a Question Answering system that scrapes the internet for information in real time. It seemed like a pretty simple task, but I'm having trouble with the web-scraping aspect. I'm pretty new to any sort of scraping so I need to get an idea of this - is it a pretty easy task to scrape Google search - like scraping the top 5 links of 10 different search queries? I feel like that's not a huge number, but I'm already having issues and I think they're related to Google blocking bots (basically the scraped links were good at first, and accurate to what was coming up when I searched manually, but then it started returning links only from sites like quora or youtube, which I couldn't get the info I wanted from). Is this something that you need to use an API for or is it pretty easy to work around with some proxy changes and stuff? Is it just Google that's difficult to work around (if it even is, maybe small-scale google search scraping is really basic?) and are other browsers search results easier to scrape?",3,2024-03-12 08:16:31

Scraping Wholesale + Products for eCommerce,"Hey everyone!
I have a wholesaler that I need to scrape because they don't have price lists or marketing materials easily laid out in .csv or any usable way for eCommerce.
I""m putting all the brand names behind spoilers cuz of the subreddit rules around linking to paid services. I just need whatever information is relevant I'm not trying to sell anyhtig, but I am willing to pay for a service that does what I need because I'm not a developer of any kind and just need this to keep going on my business. 
Website to scrape: Magenta Wholesaler Website
Info to get: descriptions, pricing, photos (multi photo products are key!), hopefully minimum quantity if it can figure out from order page.
Tools using: I'm looking at Shopify & Ecwid for my site, Scraping w/ Apify potentially? I need it to login, get the information, not DDOS or otherwise freak out the site owner with requests, and get the information I need. I am open to more laborious ways of doing this. The website itself is set up really poorly from the perspective of monitoring in any way, which is particularly difficult for an ecommerce site using them as a wholeasler triyng to get the product lists, the different categories and subcategories, the minimum quantities, and all the photos to at least get started (Eventually we'll replace with our own original assets but you need to have the default manufacturer ones to look legitimate and to compare across vendors). 
Anyways, all help is appreciated!",1,2024-03-12 06:41:24

Scraping Info From Individual Listing Profiles After Scraping the Listing Site? Help Needed!,"Hey all, I'm trying to build a workflow and tech stack for list building and need some advice. I'm trying to scrape businesses from Houzz, but am struggling with how to get the right data.
Here's the problem, when you scrape Houzz with a tool like Instant Data Scraper or Easy Scraper, you just get the company name + Houzz profile URL. The website URL, company phone number, and address is tucked within each of the Houzz profile URLs, so I need a tool that can visit each scraped Houzz profile URL and extract the data.   
So the process would essentially be:

Scrape listing page for company name + Houzz profile URLs
Add Houzz profile URLs to workflow to scrape website, phone number, and address

Anyone know of a tool that can do this? Or an alternative solution?   
I was also planning on using Clay to enrich the data further, but it would be pretty cost using it for this entire process, so I'm hoping to solve at least the basic data needs in a more cost-effective way.

🏝️ We are looking for the perfect scraping tool for travel sites. Help requested!,"Hi!
We are currently developing a portal on the subject of ""Travel and Sport"". For this we need data from various tour operators. The tour operators have a certain pool of trips that is updated once or twice a year. We have to scrape this basic data once and keep it up to date. In total, there are certainly 20 smaller websites that we have to scrape and keep up to date, although - as described - there are not changes every week. In addition, every trip has certain availabilities. These can change daily.
To summarize again:
We have around 20 websites, each with around 300 trips. We have to scrape this basic data once and then check it for updates once every two weeks. The availability of the trips is only a very small part and must be checked daily for updates.
Do you have any recommendations on the best way to do this? We have a developer with Python experience. However, it would be nice if non-coders could also use the tool.
A small budget is available for this. If it costs money, it should also be easy to use and not require an insane amount of training.
So far, my colleague has only tested Selenium very briefly. As he is the developer, he would certainly be able to cope with it. As a non-developer, I would of course prefer a web tool. We are simply looking for the best compromise.
Many thanks for your help!",6,2024-03-11 09:08:54

The fundamentals  to get the real IP is to send HTTP request to every possible IP until the real server responses back.
The full report is here:
you will need to have Go installed on your systems, here its is the code:

The URLs need javascript to display properly so scraping a single page takes around 5 seconds each in an ideal situation.
The issue is, that I want to scale this approach up to get through more URLs faster. My understanding is that the best approach is to parallelize the work across several instances, but I have never attempted this before and am a bit lost on how to proceed.
​
I have access to AWS and all its features for reference. Any starting points would be helpful.

How to scrape the videos of a private online course?,"Hello recently, i've bought a 2600$ online course, with different modules and videos with my friend, i paid for about 1000 among it and my friend payed the money left. My friend is the only one with the logins.

Can websites spot crawlers by no-mouse-movement?,"Hey folks, I've been wondering if websites like LinkedIn can spot crawlers due to entirely ""keyboard-like"" behavior. As a web developer myself, I understand that websites can detect mouse movement on their pages but do you think LinkedIn would have something crazy that can detect the ""type"" of mouse movement (including acceleration and movement paths) to distinguish between a crawler and human?
I tried my hand at Selenium but see that some websites throttle me even when I'm at a tad slower pace than a human. Perhaps their bot detection system is able to spot tha difference as bot interactions = no mouse movement?
All of that said, my idea is to perform some healthy crawling for self-use without abusing web servers and also nothing commercial.",2,2024-03-06 01:30:39

What to do when View Page Source does not show the data I want to scrape?,"Hello - I am fairly new to web scraping, but thought it would be fun to try to figure out how to scrape some data from a trading site in a game I'm playing (Elder Scrolls Online).
For reference I am using the requests module from python to try to scrape search result data from here:https://us.tamrieltradecentre.com/pc/Trade/SearchResult
My goal is to be able to look up a specific item to see if there are any new results since the last search.
The problem I'm having is that the requests module does not return the data from the search result which seems to be injected into the page in a way that is not 'scrapeable'.
When I click 'view page source' on a page with results (for example this one: https://us.tamrieltradecentre.com/pc/Trade/SearchResult?IconName=staff.png&ItemID=25784&ItemNamePattern=Phoenix+Moth+Restoration+Staff), the ' search-result-view ' shows as empty even though there are clearly results on the page and if I use inspect I can see them.
I'm trying to understand why this occurs - if perhaps this is intentionally designed to prevent people from scraping site data? I know I could use selenium to visit the site manually and get the data but it's a lot slower and more overhead so just want to see if anyone could help educate me a bit on why this approach doesn't work.

I know about the ""robots"" field in the websites' manifest, but... is this automation (i.e web scraping) merely for personal purposes illegal?

I unfair for this to be illegal, since it's just ones' automation of typing.

Scraping Deleted Reddit User Page,"Hello!
Forgive my lack of knowledge. I majored in computer science but have very little web dev knowledge. 
Anyways, I woke up today and found myself in an interesting position. Last night, I was looking through the comments of a certain reddit user, who has suddenly become a person of interest. Maybe you can figure out who it is, but it's not that important. Today, all of the comments are deleted, but I can still access them because I had the page open in Chrome. I don’t know how this stuff works; I can duplicate the tab and still see everything. I’m worried I'll suddenly lose access to it all.
I'd like to scrape the page as it is in my browser, without a refresh. Is there a way to do this? I've done some googling, but haven't found anything promising yet. Thanks!",0,2024-02-27 16:57:21
Ikea kitchen planner - adjust kitchen and gather new url + price + image using python,"Greetings all,
Background:
Ikea offers a kitchen planner where potential customers can design their own kitchen based on for example their floorplan and personal wishes.
Ikea also offers some pre-signed kitchens that are public. See for example:

I'm from the Netherlands, hence the 'nl/nl' in the weburl, but I bet similar example urls are available for the US website ('us/en').
What is nice about this feature is that it automatically generates 8 example kitchens based on the floorplan that is provided. Hence, when you adjust the floorplan manually (under 'Bepaal je ruimte'), 8 new kitchens will be generated (under 'Kies een favoriet'), each of which has a price and 'standard' image coupled to it (under 'Realiseren'). Creating a floor plan is manual by default and the url within the browser is not updated by adjusting the floorplan.
Question:
How could we use the Ikea kitchen planner to automatically generate 8 kitchens, along with their url's, prices and images after inputing the length and width of the floorplan using python?
Kind regards,
Victor",1,2024-02-27 13:35:24
Need Help with Scraping Detailed Financial Reports from ekrs.ms.gov.pl,"Hello r/webscraping!
I'm struggling with a project where I need to scrape detailed financial reports of Polish companies from a specific website. I'm looking for advice on how to do this more efficiently using Python.
Website URL: I'm aiming to scrape data from the search form results page at https://ekrs.ms.gov.pl/rdf/pd/search_df. Specifically, I'm interested in the results page that comes up after entering a KRS number, like KRS 0000402267 for example.
Data Points: My goal is to extract specific information from the financial reports, such as the company name, KRS number, fiscal year, and detailed financial data presented in the reports, like revenue, profits, assets, and liabilities.
Project Description: I'm working on a financial analysis of Polish companies and need an automated way to gather their financial reports for further analysis. I started experimenting with Selenium in Python, but I'm encountering difficulties related to the dynamic nature of the site, such as AJAX and dynamically loaded data, making my current script inefficient and unreliable.
So far, I haven't been able to find a hidden API that might simplify the process, so I'm open to any suggestions on techniques and tools that could help in this situation.
Could anyone share tips or similar experiences related to scraping sites with dynamically loaded data? What tools or libraries could help with this? What strategies can I apply to deal with the dynamic nature of this site?
I would be grateful for any advice and suggestions.",1,2024-02-27 12:15:40

I'm attempting to scrape a website, performing actions such as creating an account, signing in, posting content, and messaging someone. I'm using the mobile view feature with page.emulate(phone), where the phone model is obtained from Puppeteer's knownDevices list.I've tried various approaches like Puppeteer Extra, the Stealth plugin, and even using Puppeteer with a real browser, but the website always detects my scraping attempts.

Scraping Large Amount of PDF’s - General Advice,"I have a someone who wants me to extract PDF’s from a judiciary website that contains court documents.
It has a simple captcha that was easy to crack with some binarization and denoising techniques using OpenCV and PyTesseract. The inner HTML, the content I am after, is generated and retrieved via AJAX calls.
The problem is that there’s an upward amount of 12+ million PDF’s on the site alone which as you all can obviously guess takes a lot of storage to hold all that. 
Anyone have any general advice on what you’d do in this situation?

Puppeteer supremacy?,"Hello I just wanted to get your guys' opinions on which if puppeteer is the end all of browser automation. From what I've read puppeteer seems to mimic the browser the best, even loading tiktok livestreams which selenium and playwright are unable to do. That is not even including pupetteer extra and stealth plugin. I guess the only wonder is if I can prevent RTC leak on pupetteer as I was unable to do that with selenium and playwright. But it seems like at least from what i've read is that puppeteer runs the game and selenium and playwright are just mistakes who need to be erased from existence.",0,2024-02-24 07:23:10
Need Advice for a Large-scale Web Scraping Project: VPNs vs. Proxies,"Hi everyone,
I'm embarking on a substantial web scraping project and could use some guidance. I'm targeting a website with around 4 million product pages, available in two languages, which brings the total to about 8 million pages. The silver lining is that these pages can be accessed via .json links, offering a way to minimize traffic impact. The site is protected by Cloudflare, but I've managed to bypass this using VPN provider so far.
In my tests, I've successfully run 5 Docker containers concurrently under a single VPN account, each using different IPs. However, this is just the start. I plan to scale my operations to scrape up to 100 million pages. This scaling brings me to a crossroads: should I invest in 3-4 VPN accounts, or would proxies be a better route? I've never used proxies before, so I'm particularly interested in insights about their effectiveness, cost, and how they might compare to using multiple VPN accounts for a project of this scale.
Any advice, experiences, or tips you can share would be incredibly valuable, especially regarding handling large-scale scraping projects, managing IP rotation, and staying under the radar of protections like Cloudflare.
Thanks in advance for your help!",7,2024-02-22 16:51:03
Looking for iMacros add-on alternative for Google Chrome's browser since in June 2024 they will update to manifest 3.0 and iMacros is with manifest 2.0 is no longer supported to be updated?,"Hello,
I'm currently using iMacros add-on for my Google Chrome browser which works fine for the latest version of it. I have some automations recordings I have with it, and it's very fast and light, compared to using something like chromedriver watir automations. And I like that you don't need any special mode of the browser to run it.
I read that Google plan in June 2024 to update their browser to require manifest 3.0 which means many browser add-ons will stop working unless the add-ons are updated to manifest 3.0, and iMacros is end of life and no longer supported.
Will there be another way to continue to use the iMacros add-on despite of that?
Any ideas or alternatives?

Making a fetch request to Google search URL,"Hi all! 👋
I’m trying to deploy a very simple Express.js API that, given a few query parameters, constructs a Google search query and performs a simple fetch request on that URL (since Google pages are server side rendered, you can try this by using Postman and sending a GET to any query url). This works totally fine locally and I’m able to manipulate the returned HTML, but when I deploy this (using fly.io) my request gets blocked by Google and I get a captcha. 
All I need is the HTML - I do all of the parsing logic using Cheerio and don’t see the need to spin up a headless browser instance (using Puppeteer or Playwright) for this. 
Any recommendations for how to get around the blocked fetch request on my deployed API? Maybe I should try a different deployment strategy? Open to any and all recommendations… been scratching my head all day on this one.",3,2024-02-22 05:32:37

How do you notify yourself when something is going wrong?,"In my job, I often have to write small scrapers to gather information.

Seeking Advice on Integrating Human Captcha Resolution with Scrapy,"Hey everyone,
I'm currently working on a web scraping project using Scrapy, and I've encountered some challenges when dealing with websites that have captchas. I've been trying to figure out a way to integrate human intervention for resolving captchas within my scraping workflow, and then delegate the control back to Scrapy to continue with the scraping process.
My goal is to create a program that can detect when a captcha appears during scraping, pause the process, prompt a human to resolve the captcha manually, and then resume scraping once the captcha has been resolved.
I've looked into various approaches, such as using external captcha solving services, but I'm interested in creating a more custom solution where the user can interact with the captcha directly.

Deduplication via previews,"I am trying to download large quantities of images from Reddit, but many of the images are duplicates. I could deduplicate them by requesting all of the images and putting them in a hash table after they are downloaded, but this would require me to send a ton of requests, and the whole purpose of deduplication is to keep the execution time low in the first place.
Because Reddit loads low-resolution previews of most images before loading the full image, I thought I could find some way of grabbing these previews from the local storage or cache because they have already been loaded in. This would keep me from having to send requests for the images. However, I am unable to find any information on this technique, and I don't even know if it's possible.

Online Course,"Hi all.
I'm hoping someone could kindly help.
I have paid 2.5k for an online course alongside my employment, and after requesting a PDF copy to make it easier for me to study, it was declined therefore I'm having to read a prominently text-based course from a screen (I'm a bit old fashioned). Although there are several video based links this is not important.
Now, forgive me as I don't really understand scraping, yet I was advised that it might be an option. Would anyone please point me in the right direction and offer some advice whether scraping is suitable to extract all text and images to a PDF?
Maybe I'm asking in the wrong place so apologies if I am.

Web Scraping Instagram simulating the official app,"I am developing software through which, after users log in to Instagram and obtain a bearer token enabling private calls to Instagram, they can synchronize their Instagram data.
This synchronization procedure consists of a series of consecutive API requests to Instagram: obtaining user info (username, fullname, etc.), obtaining followers, obtaining following, and obtaining posts. I have replicated the requests exactly as they are made in the official app down to the smallest detail.
I need this procedure to be performed by the user as many times as they want without having to re-login each time to obtain a new token.
The issue is that every 2-3 synchronizations, Instagram responds with a 'challenge required' error due to suspected scraping, forcing the user to log in again and effectively invalidating the bearer token. I have also tried introducing a delay between each request, but the result is the same.
I suspect that some requests made by the official app allow the token not to be invalidated because they are considered 'secure' and 'not-scraping' , but I cannot figure out which ones.
Does anyone have any information on this that could be helpful? Does anyone have an idea of how Instagram identifies certain API requests as suspicious scraping, leading to the invalidation of the session?",4,2024-02-13 15:10:59

Enterprise Web Scraping: What to look out for,"Hello r/webscraping,
I see a lot of similar questions on this subreddit and thought I would add my 2 cents and try and cover a lot of the pitfalls I see when people start trying to scrape at scale. If you're asking the question ""how do I scrape 100 million pages in a month that run javascript/keeps blocking me/will be maintainable long term"", this guide might be for you.
Context
I'm a Senior Engineer who has specialized in specifically web automation for a few years now. I currently oversee about ~100 million requests a month and lead a small team in my endeavors. I've had the chance to research and implement most current tooling and hope to provide folks here with the most information I possibly can (while trying to stay inside the sub's rules 😃). This ""guide"" will mostly cover high-levels of requests, Websites that utilize Javascript, and bot detection (as these are what I have the most experience dealing with).
Tech Stack
There is a multitude of different options, but the ones I typically shoot for on a project are:
- Typescript
- Puppeteer (or puppeteer-extra depending)
- AWS (SQS, RDS, EC2)
Proxies
Proxies mask your origin IP address from the website. These are EXTREMELY important if you plan to make a bunch of requests to one site (or multiple). There are a bunch of proxy services that are fine to use, but they all have their downsides, unfortunately. If you have to cover a bunch of requests to a bunch of websites, and there is a chance they are blocking IPs or verifying the credibility of the IP through some online flagging database, then I would recommend going with a larger, more credible proxy service. The goal is to have clean and fast proxies. If they aren't clean, you can easily get blocked. If they aren't fast, they will increase your infra pricing and possibly cause your jobs to fail. I typically use services that have an IP pool in the millions and utilize a few at a time in case of outages or an uptick in failures.
Captchas
The ultimate robot stopper.... not. There are a ton of captcha-solving services on the market that you can just pay for API usage and never have to worry about again. Pricing and speeds vary. I've found that AI-based solvers are the best sometimes. AI solvers are the fastest and the cheapest, but the best ones I've used can't solve every kind of captcha (IIRC HCaptchas are the problem), so if you're solving for multiple sites, you may need a few different solutions. I'd recommend this anyway because if there is ever an outage (which does occur when there are captcha updates), then you have a backup for when jobs start failing. A little extra code will automatically switch over services when stuff starts failing 😃
Browsers
The one thing that probably matters the most when interacting with bot detection at scale. These solutions are somewhat new to the market. I've even made my own in some cases, and this is probably the one thing that I don't see mentioned frequently (if at all?) on this sub. There is a bunch of cool browser tooling out there that have their particular use cases. Some are licensed out containers, some are connection-based. That being said, they all do a somewhat similar job. Introduce entropy into the browser and mask the CDP connections to the browser. When interacting with the browser via a script (and technically without), there a leaks everywhere that make it easy for big bot solutions to figure out what's up. There's simple stuff that can be fixed with the scraping libs out there (user agents, etc), but there is also stuff like canvas/webgl fingerprinting that isn't as fixable with these libraries. Most large-scale bot detection tools use quite a few fingerprinting tools that get quite in-depth. I would not recommend trying to tackle these solutions solo if you don't have years to spend doing research and learning about the nuances of the space.
Infra
I've only found AWS to be ""the one"" in terms of being able to scale up to a level that I require. Sorry if this breaks rule 2, but this is what I've used and seen success with. Other solutions are going to be difficult to maintain and develop long term. I specifically utilize EC2/ECS for the scraping portion because tooling like Lamda/Fargate (although cheaper) doesn't offer the privileges that more ""aggressive"" scraping might require.has
Clustering
A must when trying to achieve millions of jobs a month. My solution for this is at a few different levels. Node has some built-in packages that allow for clustering which is great for maximizing machine usage and optimizing scale costs. Next would be utilizing ASGs in AWS to scale up the number of machines we are using. After that, we would accept requests from a queuing service) doesn't offer the privileges that more ""aggressive"" scraping might require.
Queuing
Queuing is great for this stuff. Jobs take an unknown amount of time and can run extremely long if there is an outage somewhere. I  would recommend this all day and if you don't currently have a queue for your jobs and you are looking to scale, do it.
Retries
Failures are inevitable, but you don't have to let all that precious data getaway. If you want to do this at scale, we need to determine if a job has failed and have a system in place for getting that data again. This is where queuing is important. Having tooling where you know if something has failed and being able to add it back into the queue is so important at a large scale that I shouldn't even have to mention it. Don't forget this.
Cost Savings
There are tons of places for you to save money on this. Negotiating infra, captcha, browser, and proxy costs down to understanding every single request you make. Proxies can get expensive. There is great tooling in Puppeteer (extra?) that lets you manage each request and even bypass your proxy and download it straight to you. I would say just make sure if you do this, know which requests your allowing, and which you are letting bypass or you could run into some issues. Essentially, we should look to optimize to have the least amount of requests, and the least amount of data downloaded as possible without jeopardizing our identity.
Metrics
It's easy to see if your scripts are working locally, but sometimes not everything is as easy in the cloud. This is one of the most important things if you plan to scale is understanding your requests. Please, please, please utilize reporting tools so you know that the data that you are getting is correct and is coming in at the size that you need. There are no ifs, ands, or buts. Especially if you are dealing with clients on your project.
Conclusion
There are a ton of variables in large-scale web scraping that need to be accounted for. Bot detection, rising costs, and cumbersome tooling are just a few you WILL encounter. I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors and hope this guide provided a little guidance into where you should start looking or continue your journey.

Chipotle Menu Price Web Scraping,"Hello All!
​
I am new to this subreddit and I recently thought of an idea that I would like to explore. I want to gather Chipotle (and maybe other restaurants) data on menu prices and their corresponding rewards point values in order to see how much value one can get by redeeming various rewards. Ideally, the web/mobile app would update and values would change as well. I was also thinking this could be scaled and expanded to a point where users could check close-by locations and see which locations have better prices and/or rewards exchange values.
​
I recently came across this GitHub Repo where there is code to search by location and find Chipotles near you, but I wasn't able to tell if I could get the specific data I am looking for just from the code in this repo. There is a Youtube Video here as well for reference if needed.

Seeking advice on my data subscription model and industry norms,"Hi. I'm offering a leads data subscription model and developing my own API to facilitate it. The subscription includes receiving 2000 new leads monthly for a fixed rate. With each passing month, a new set of leads is served through the API. As I'm relatively new to the concept of data subscription models, I'm wondering whether subscribers should only access the current month's dataset or also retain access to data from previous months during their subscription period.
To illustrate with an example:
- The subscription provides 2000 rows per month.
- Alice subscribes to the dataset in January and downloads batch #1.
- In February, Alice downloads batch #2, containing the new leads.
According to industry norms, would Alice anticipate ongoing access to batch #1 as well, perhaps through a versioning parameter or similar mechanism?

How to approach this data scraping project,"Hi there!
So I’m a little informed but not great. 
My company requires us to scrape Amazon and capture supplements fact data from supplement product labels.
That’s of course in addition to:

msrp
reviews
bought this month
type
count of capsules / weight of powder 
about this item
reviews 
ratings
title name
page link 

I’ve already got octoparse pulling most of it ok. But how do I approach the labels?
Literally the ceo wants to be able to look at all the competitors mg of vitamin c for example in a vitamin c supplement and then figure it out how it relates to retail price.
So he wants to be able to be like:

ok this has 1 mg of vitamin c
the retail price is $10
there are 10 capsules
serving size is 1 capsule 

$10 / 10 capsules = $1 capsule
$1 capsule / 1 mg of vitamin c = $1 per mg of vitamin c
And we want to pull the data at mass. As I said octoparse has been ok with some issues but the hand calculating takes forever.
There has to be a service right? Or a better way?",1,2024-02-08 23:58:39

Ever experience ISP provided routers blocking requests?,"In testing a scraping script, I noticed if I batched a thousand or more requests(to a proxy) at once I would get 98% failure rate with an ""ETIMEDOUT"" error- and more suspicious, other sites just from my browser failed.  After turning on a VPN all this disappeared.  The only thing I can think of causing this is my router is doing some kind of DDOS prevention.  Any idea on what could be causing it?",1,2024-02-06 05:32:31
Any experience scraping facebook groups?,"The facebook api does not expose public group posts and comments unless you're the group admin. Which is why I resort to a regular approach. To use the search, an account is needed, and I tried automating the registration to counter the draconian rate limits imposed by the website, but I haven't gotten any further than the confirmation view, which if any of the proxies got lucky and a confirmation code is sent, the account keeps being suspended unless confirmed from the browser (not selenium, it doesn't work). Got any useful tips in that regard?
I'm using a python requests approach with proxy rotation. Any idea why most if not all requests are detected despite emulating the browser's requests, cookies, headers, ...?",10,2024-02-05 14:05:37
Scraping the Samsung TV App Store,"Anyone have experience scraping the samsung TV app store? Wondering if there's any APIs to it, or a new website to a list of their apps. I used to this URL (samsung.com/us/appstore/browse) to grab info but now it forwards all apps to 404s. Any help/hints appreciated.",1,2024-02-06 01:06:55

"Is it possible to scrape hidden data contained in JS object, which is cleared from the DOM after page load?","I'm developing a scraper which uses playwright and a proxy network to scrape company overview information and reviews from Glassdoor. Here is an example URL:
https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/NVIDIA-Reviews-E7633.htm?filter.countryId=1&filter.countryId=3
Strangely when I was testing it before on a different company with this URL:
https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/eBay-Motors-Group-Reviews-E4189745.htm?filter.countryId=1&filter.countryId=3
I was able to extract the 'apolloState' object that I'm interested in, which is contained within a script tag in the HTML directly. But now for NVIDIA it doesn't seem to be able to find it.
As far as I understand, Glassdoor uses GraphQL to populate data such as company reviews. I'm interested in the script tag which contains the object 'window.appCache' as shown in the screenshot in the element tab of the devtools.
elements tab, window.appCache
However, as you can see it is only javascript with no properties containing the reviews data, but when I check the source HTML in the sources tab of the devtools, as shown in the screenshots, the 'window.appCache' object has an 'apolloState' property which contains json objects with all the overview and reviews data I want to extract.
sources tab, window.appCache
sources tab, apolloState
Am I right in my understanding, that javascript runs the script on page load to populate the elements of the page with its corresponding key value pairs from the apolloState's json and then the script removes the ‘apolloState’ object from the DOM? If this is correct, should I then be trying to extract the 'apolloState' object before javascript runs the script? And how should I go about doing this?
Also, not sure if it is correct to refer to the 'apolloState' as an object or property, apologies for that.
When I refresh the page and filter by document requests in the network tab of the devtools, I can also find the 'apolloState' object in the script tag, as shown in these screenshots:
network tab, window.appCache
network tab, apolloState
I've been searching for an answer to this question, but I haven't found anything that completely answers it for me. If anyone can shed some light on the issue it would be greatly appreciated, thank you in advance.
Also, here is the relevant python code which should extract the 'apolloState' object from the HTML.
I think the problem is in the `find_hidden_data()` function, or more accurately that once the page loads the 'apolloState' object is removed from the DOM so the function can’t find it.
I left out the Url class that builds the URLs for me as well since this is already quite a long question. You'll notice it is called to test the script in the `if __name__ == ""__main__"":` block.
Here is the Github repository for the project, in case anyone wants to take a deeper look at the entire code: https://github.com/qma9/glassdoor-scraper

What are the best options for web scraping with low level languages ?,"I've scraped the Web using languages like Python and Typescript many many times. But these days, I'm kind of into low-level languages like cpp & rust. I wonder what other low-level languages and libraries people use to scrape the web.

"Puppeteer keeps timing out, why? [Docker, Puppeteer, NodeJS]","Right now I'm trying to archive a page with Docker and Puppeteer, here is my Dockerfile and here is my TypeScript code.

Would like help scraping thousands of public domain stock images and sharing them for free,"This is a long story to bear with me. So for some extra context, finding old stock photos isn't very easy. You can find blogs with a few of them here and there or old CD ROMs from the 90s, but if you want to find 30s-70s stock photography in bulk you're kinda screwed. These photos are really useful when wanting to create vintage looking advertisements and researching commercial art and historical aesthetics. During my search for these, I found H. Armstrong Roberts, basically the first stock photographer who started selling his photos commercially as early as 1920. Roberts library was distributed by a company named Retrofile in the 2000s along with an assortment of other old stock libraries that are currently unknown in their origin. Retrofile was bought in 2005 by Getty Images, and while a good chunk of those libaries existed on ClassicStock and RobertStock, those were also bought out by Getty later on. As of right now, Getty owns the entire Armstrong Roberts/Retrofile archive.
Here's the thing: Roberts died in 1947. Not only did he die in 1947 but none of his photos had their copyright registered. Given that he died over 70 years ago, his entire body of work is public domain. Given that Getty also lists Retrofile's other archives under Roberts name even though he was already dead, theoretically these are also public domain until proof can be provided that they belonged to someone else. They are listed under his name, so they should be treated as such.
Alamy currently hosts the ClassicStock/Roberts archive on their website, and while it isn't as complete as Getty's, what makes this special is images can be downloaded freely from Alamy using downloader.la. While they aren't super high quality, they are usable when working on a 1080p canvas.
What I want to do is figure out a way to download the entire Roberts archive in bulk, watermark free, with the titles as their file names and then upload those to the Internet Archive (or some other file service). There is no reason why these photos should be behind a paywall and I think it would be of great use to many designers and researchers.
I cannot program in Python or any other language, but I do have a very weak understanding in how to run said scripts and have done so before. I request someone who is interested in this project and would be open to writing a script that can download the entire collection in bulk using the same system that downloader.la uses (or better if possible.)
The H. Armstrong Roberts collection can be viewed here.
I am not asking for you to store them yourself, I just need a python script or some other tool I can run and I'll take care of the files from there.",7,2024-01-28 02:33:23
How to bypass PerimeterX,"PerimeterX (now Human Security) is an anti-bot software that leverages advanced machine learning and behavioral analytics to accurately identify and block malicious bot traffic in real-time. There is currently 153,000 websites using PerimeterX.
Recognize PerimeterX
To identify PerimeterX's presence on a website, look for these characteristics:

Internal property: window._pxAppId property.
Collector XHR: PerimeterX can operate with or without any external server, in case of external collector, those domains can be used: px-cdn.net, pxchk.net, px-client.net In case of an internal endpoint being used, it's format will likely follow this format: /rf8vapwA/xhr/api/v2/collector
Cookies: PerimeterX set the cookies: _px3, _pxhd, _px_vid

PerimeterX's Device Fingerprinting
PerimeterX employs traditional techniques commonly observed in other anti-bot software, but with a particular focus on WebGL by assessing rendering capabilities. This approach goes beyond the usual strategy of merely collecting parameters and extensions, as seen in most anti-bot solutions.
General fingerprinting

devicePixelRatio
hardwareConcurrency
localStorage
indexedDB
openDatabase
sessionStorage
cpuClass
Navigator.plugins
window.performance

Behavior Analysis
PerimeterX observes various specified events and compiles them into a consistent payload for their collector API endpoint. This suggests that they utilize behavioral analysis. As a result, it's important to be careful when activating these events. To closely replicate human interactions with the page, it is advisable to employ simulation libraries.

touchstart
touchend
touchmove
touchenter
touchleave
touchcancel
mousedown
mouseup
mousemove
mouseover
mouseout
mouseenter
mouseleave
click
dblclick
scroll
wheel

mouse type events coordinates and details are tracked on the following attributes:

coordination_start
coordination_end
movementX
movementY
clientX
clientY

For touch type events, the following attributes are tracked:

touches
changedTouches

Canvas Fingerprinting
PerimeterX utilizes a technique involving the use of unicode special characters for fingerprinting canvas renderings. This method is based on the significant variability in how unicode renders high-entropy elements like emojis.
First test: Renders all characters using ""8px sans-serif"" default font from 0x1F600 to 0x1F64F.
a.font = ""8px sans-serif"";
for (var o = 1, c = 128512; c < 128591; c++)
   a.fillText(_(""0x"" + c.toString(16)), 8 * o, 8),
   o++;
n = Q(a.canvas.toDataURL())

Second test: Renders the following characters using ""6px sans-serif"" default font:
97, 667, 917, 1050, 1344, 1488, 1575, 1808, 1931, 2342, 2476, 2583, 2711, 2825, 2980, 3108, 3221, 3374, 3517, 3524, 3652, 3749, 3926, 4121, 4325, 4877, 5091, 5123, 6017, 6190, 6682, 7070, 11612, 20206, 27721, 41352, 43415, 54620, 55295

And then the characters from 0x2699 to 0x26FF.
Results: https://imgur.com/a/oCyUD48

Notice: Result original resolution has been preserved, notice how small and pixely the rendering is, this allow better fingerprinting of anti-aliasing technique, and produce more entropy while being lighter.

WebGL fingerprinting:
PerimeterX checks for specific Anisotropic extension to detect browser type, among those values:

EXT_texture_filter_anisotropic
WEBKIT_EXT_texture_filter_anisotropic (Safari)
MOZ_EXT_texture_filter_anisotropic (Firefox)

This method is highly efficient for identifying browser type spoofing because the properties involved cannot be falsified through traditional JavaScript proxy or Function override techniques.

Execute the following shaders for WebGL fingerprinting:
Vertex Shader:
attribute vec2 attrVertex;
varying vec2 varyinTexCoordinate;
uniform vec2 uniformOffset;

void main(){
   varyinTexCoordinate = attrVertex + uniformOffset;
   gl_Position = vec4(attrVertex,0,1);

varying vec2 varyinTexCoordinate;
void main() {
   gl_FragColor = vec4(varyinTexCoordinate,0,1);
}

Both are executed on a single program and then dumped using canvas.toDataURL.
Clipboard data
Not sure how much this influence the bypass success rate, but PerimeterX does look for Clipboard Data as part of their fingerprinting process.
Fonts presence & rendering
PerimeterX will attempt to render the text mmmmmmmmmmlli for the following fonts list:
""Andale Mono"", ""Arial"", ""Arial Black"", ""Arial Hebrew"", ""Arial MT"", ""Arial Narrow"", ""Arial Rounded MT Bold"", ""Arial Unicode MS"", ""Bitstream Vera Sans Mono"", ""Book Antiqua"", ""Bookman Old Style"", ""Calibri"", ""Cambria"", ""Cambria Math"", ""Century"", ""Century Gothic"", ""Century Schoolbook"", ""Comic Sans"", ...

How to bypass PerimeterX
Bypassing PerimterX's security requires a nuanced approach, especially considering its reliance on GPU rendering information to determine the operating system and device type.
Here are some strategies:

GPU Rendering: Emulate consumer-grade GPUs rather than professional hardware, as Akamai's algorithms are tuned to recognize and differentiate between them.
Behavioral Analysis: Utilize tools like ghost-cursor (found at https://npmjs.com/package/ghost-cursor) to simulate human-like cursor movements and keystrokes. Timing is crucial here; movements or keystrokes that are too rapid can be flagged as suspicious.

Scrape Data From an Android App?,"I am looking for a way to scrape data from an Android App for educational purposes. There is an app I have in mind that sells groceries and I would like to scrape the items along with their prices. From research I understand that to do this I need an emulator + HTTP Proxy, reverse engineer the API call that receives this data and use python requests to capture it. I have never worked with Emulators and HTTP proxies before; so here are the questions:
1) Is there an easier way to do it? 
2) are there open source/free tools for HTTP proxy and emulators? I found ones online and they seem to be for a price.
3) Any proper threads/resource I can use for educational purposes? I basically learned web scraping through selenium, beautiful soup and API but all from web pages.

How to Build a Price Tracking Bot that utilizes real-time data 24/7,"I see many people on Twitter create a price tracking bot which tracks real-time data of when a product drops in price.
They get this data immediately, right when it drops. I'm not sure how this is possible for them to get real-time data without them getting rate limited.
The only way I see that's possible is that they are constantly making the HTTP Request to the specific product 24/7 every second. But this seems too expensive. Especially since their price tracking bots can track thousands and thousands of products.
So what technique are they using to get real-time data for when a product changes prices?
If I were to currently attempt to make one, I would be forced to check prices like every hour or something(so I don't go over the rate limit). How are they bypassing that?",13,2024-01-26 03:10:49
In need of a simple tool to search a website for words that are typically not searchable.,"Hello,
I need a tool that can pull up a search on a website for info that is typically shown only to logged in users but not searchable.
To be more precise, this is the website: https://ecase.justice.bg/Case
Every single day courts from all around the country upload new cases with parties involved in them. The info is „public“ to logged in lawyers. To the rest of the public it’s also visible but names are „blanked out“ - James Brown would be J. B. 
In the website, one can search by numbers/years/courts and so on, not by name of a party involved in a case, and the info is there, it’s just not searchable. 
Googling the website and a name sometimes works for a couple of results but it’s not very helpful because it’s cases from way back that google has indexed.
Is there any tool that I can sort of modify to search on the backend of the website and give me the case number/year that this person/company is involved in?
Something like the reddit camas search from years ago?",1,2024-01-26 04:21:56

Transform Your Android Phone into an Efficient Proxy Server,"First, you need to install the Localtonet app on your phone by download it from the Google Play Store here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.localtonet.localtonetapp

On the Localtonet app on your phone, paste the AuthToken in. You should see an Android icon on the ""My tokens"" page.
You can adjust the settings for how often the phone goes into airplane mode, and you can also generate a reset link.
If  your phone is not rooted, when you generate a reset link, trigger it  once and the default assistant settings page will open. From there,  select Localtonet as the default assistant.
Next, go to https://localtonet.com/tunnel/proxyserver and choose either HTTP or SOCKS proxy, then create it. Click ""Start"" to start the proxy server.
You  can connect to the server using the IP address and port number  provided. You can also set a username and password in the tunnel  settings.

Confused about mobile Endpoints,"Hello,
I came across tiktok-scraper on github (no longer maintained) and was looking at how they coded up the scraper, afaic tell they were taking the session id FROM THE PC BROWSER session and putting them into a nodejs MOBILE server request  
a line in the script for const request:
https:\/\/m.tiktok.com\/node\/share\/user\/@\w+\?uniqueId=(\w+)&verifyFp=$/.test(uri):  
I'm kind of confused how this can work? Does this assume that the mobile api endpoint won't check the user-agent string and or what proxy/ip is being used (4g vs residential proxy for initial session for example)? I would assume something like this will get blocked immediatley if the sessionid doesn't come from a mobile session with the same user-agent?  
Since I'm new to bulk webscraping, why do they use the mobile endpoint (if I'm not mistaken)? Softer security measures and different limits? Does the response on mobile differ from the response on webbrowser? Do they cut out loading the MB heavy parts of the response in that way?  
Wouldn't I need a unique mobile footprint for each scraper in this case? I know there are services out there that can provide me with that, but my understanding is I would need to intercept each one of the request first for each instance of the mobile connection to get the unique fingerprint first and then  create a mitm connection->then scrape the response + I would need to mimic typical user session behaviour iiuc(?)   
Another thing that is puzzling to me is the use of a nodejs server, I thought birp et al are used for these types of scraping activity?

trying to get more insights into the use of selenium on google -colab - a handson approach,"​
​
i am trying to get more insights into the use of selenium on google -colab. 
for that i have read lots of documents and tried outsome steps on  colab: now  i w ant to discuss this with you ... 
​
this is the beginning of a tiny - manual of what can go wrong ever  - if you want to run little scraper that does all that - just read on. 
​
btw: this is a very rough manual - lots of  you can add thoughts ideas and more... so come on - add your ideas ...
​
To use Selenium in Google Colab, you first need to install the necessary packages and set up the WebDriver. Here's a simple example of a Selenium web scraper in Google Colab:
​
​
​
​
# `Install necessary packages
!pip install selenium
!apt-get update
!apt install -y chromium-chromedriver

# Set up WebDriver
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options

chrome_options = Options()
chrome_options.add_argument('--headless')  # Run Chrome in headless mode (no GUI)
chrome_options.add_argument('--no-sandbox')
chrome_options.add_argument('--disable-dev-shm-usage')

# Specify the path to the chromedriver executable
chrome_driver_path = ""/usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromedriver""

# Create a WebDriver instance
driver = webdriver.Chrome(chrome_driver_path, options=chrome_options)

# Example: Open Google and search for a term
search_term = ""Hello, Google Colab!""
driver.get(""https://www.google.com/"")
search_box = driver.find_element(""name"", ""q"")
search_box.send_keys(search_term)
search_box.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)

# Wait for a few seconds to let the results load
driver.implicitly_wait(5)

# Print the title of the page
print(""Page title:"", driver.title)

# Close the browser window
driver.quit()

```
​
**important**:  Make sure to adjust the chrome_driver_path based on the version of the Chrome browser installed in the Colab environment.
**my guess**: well  i guess that i have to take care for the adjustment of the ""chrome _driver_path""  based on the version of the chrome-brwoser that is installed in the colab environment 
​
see what i ve got back - how  to proceed?

`

- how  to proceed?
​
It seems like there's a version mismatch or an issue with the webdriver.Chrome initialization in your code. The error suggests that there's a problem with the arguments being passed to the WebDriver constructor.
Try modifying the webdriver.Chrome initialization line like this:
`
# Create a WebDriver instance`

driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=chrome_driver_path, options=chrome_options)

​
This ensures that the chrome_driver_path is explicitly provided as the executable_path argument. Please update your code accordingly and see if it resolves the issue.
If the issue persists, there might be a compatibility problem between the ChromeDriver version and the Chrome browser version. In such cases, you may need to download the appropriate version of ChromeDriver that matches the installed version of Chrome in your Colab environment.
well -  we can download ChromeDriver from the official website: 
https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/
​
After downloading, upload the ChromeDriver executable to the Colab environment and adjust the chrome_driver_path accordingly.

Scrape articles from Apple News widget on iOS,"Hello everyone, 
even though Apple News has officially launched in very few countries, Apple still offers an Apple News widget (see screenshot below) that displays curated articles (as far as I know they are updated once a day).

What a more professional scraping project looks like?,"Hello reddit,
Currently I have a project where i have between 50-70 spiders in scrapy that i need to run throughout the year. I think my current set up is not bad, but I would like to see more professional pipelines looks like or maybe you have some suggestion for me. Let's use this thread to discuss, it may help more people.
​
My current approach is more or less as follows
- First i collect all urls with needed filters from the websites, and store them neatly in a google sheets (i know, maybe db is better but google sheets allows me to quickly make any changes if need be, and this document is very alive)
- I have individual spiders for each website
- Go through all the items in the website, and then go through the pipelines to clean the data...etc and store the final data into a postgresql database
- Then each page is saved in .html format in my local file system, just in case the data inserted in the database is wrong and i need to restart again, i just scrape the offline files instead of doing it online agai
- Then i have several one-off scripts, but the main one is extract to excel, where i take the data i want, do some analysis of some missing attributes...etc and then produce a final excel file, nicely formated with the results, ready to be sent to a client.
​
This is more or less a high level view, but do you have any other approach to this? do you maybe store the whole HTML in the database? or store the 'unclean' data in database and then have some ETL process?, in my current process i do all the cleaning before i insert into database, so that in database i always have the clean data

"New to programming and web scraping in general, in python how can I iterate over a complete site that has URLs end in /xyz/""some random text""","the /xyz/ is always constant however not sure how I can iterate over a site where all the URLs end in different and random text
This is the site in question:
https://wodwell.com/
​
I want to get all the URLs for all the workouts for example
https://wodwell.com/wod/hotshots-19/
I want to scrape the following data
hotshots-19
CROSSFIT HERO WOD

and the entire description text so all the info below
6 Rounds For Time
30 Air Squats
19 Power Cleans (135/95 lb)
7 Strict Pull-Ups
400 meter Run
With a running clock, as fast as possible perform 6 rounds of the work in the order written: 30 Air Squats, 19 Power Cleans, 7 Strict Pull-Ups, and then a 400 meter Run.
Score is the time it takes to complete the 6 rounds.
Movement Standards
Strict Pull-Ups: Begin with your hands on the Pull-Up Bar just outside your shoulders, arms fully extended. Without any help/momentum from the lower body (no kip), pull so your chin gets higher than the bar. Complete at full arm extension.
Good Score for “Hotshots 19” (estimated)
– Beginner: 35+ minutes – Intermediate: 30-34 minutes – Advanced: 25-29 minutes – Elite: <24 minutes Tips and Strategy Choose a steady, moderate pace (around 75-80% of your max pace). A fast pace out of the gate will likely lead to burn out and a poor overall score. When you complete round 1, look at the clock. Aim to complete each of the next 5 rounds at the same pace, +/- 30 seconds. The crux of this WOD is going from 19 Power Cleans directly into 7 Strict Pull-Ups: They are both pulling exercises, so you’ll experience major fatigue in your grip, biceps, shoulders, and lats. Break up the Power Cleans early (5+5+5+4 or 8+6+5 for example) to ensure that you don’t get trapped at the Pull-Up Bar for too long. Intended Stimulus “Hotshots 19” should feel long and exhausting. The Power Clean load should feel relatively light. If this workout were 4 rounds, it would probably be “enjoyable;” the 6 rounds make this WOD brutally hard. Scaling Options This Hero WOD is long and high volume. Reduce the volume, the load, and or skill level (see: Pull-Up Scaling) to keep this workout under 40 minutes. Intermediate Option 6 Rounds for Time of: 30 Air Squats 19 Power Cleans (115/75 lb) 3 Strict Pull-Ups 400 meter Run Beginner Option 4 Rounds for Time of: 15 Air Squats 10 Power Cleans (75/55 lb)  5 Ring Rows 400 meter Run

Another example would be this url
https://wodwell.com/wod/robert-nagel/?ref=listmodal 
workout name is robert-nagel
555 FITNESS HERO WOD
and has the following info that I would like to persist 
​
3 Rounds for Time
100 foot Overhead Walking Lunges (45/25 lb)
20 Wall Ball Shots (20/14 lb)
20 Box Jumps (24/20 in)
10 Push Presses (135/95 lb)

​
I am doing this for an online course as my final project, want to scrape all workouts and persist them in a DB. Site doesnt offer APIs,
each workout has a name, so the url is always /wod/workout name/
just not sure how I can get all the names so I can use requests and beautiful soup to scrape them after using a base url of https://wodwell.com/wod and append the workout name 
I am very new to this so would appreciate some input and thanks for your help",2,2024-01-21 06:29:50
Advice on best method to scrape codebase documentation (ultimately into a format suitable for RAG for LLMs),"As title says, I'm looking into what methods I should research or test, to pull some codebase documentation. For example, the documentation on, say, how to use typescript for JS (just an example, as I know there are already LLMs that may know that).
I guess this would involve getting a scraping tool to crawl everything on a subdomain or subfolder, for example codinglanguageexample.com/docs/ or docs.codingexample.net  as fake EGs.
I would like to do this free or lowest possible cost. But the more I research scraping, the less possible anything free seems to be.
Anyway, formatting:
Been learning steadily - but most examples are ""how to scrape Amazon! How to scrape hotels!"" and that's all data to CSV.
Whereas coding docs will be paragraphs interspersed with code examples, not lists of tabular data.
Best method to clean and format may be dependent on the parent method of obtaining the data in the first place? EG if I could somehow pull it all via some basic python and puppeteer we'd clean with BS4, right? But if we obtained it with another method it may be cleaner/messier? (apologies for vagueness).

The code is quite simple, I use a GET request and then get it's content, then further I'm using it with JSDOM to search through it. Until then, the content is having the broken characters. Here's the simple code as an example:
return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {

Selenium '.text' different than all other methods to get source on dynamic page,"Chrome 120; Selinum, Chromedriver 120; Python
Just want to automate my flight price searches on kayak. It was working for abut 3 months.  I changed up the search for a new flight and now having issues.   Changed to headful for now (was headless).  I manually wait 25 seconds for dynamic content to load (webdrivewait never seems to work right for me, but that tries to wait an additional 30).  I just want the source so I can parse with beautifulsoup, but I can't seem the CURRENT (dynamically loaded) page source.  The following returns price info:

driver.find_element(By.XPATH '//body').text

But I need structured data, not just the text. The following DO NOT work (all return 0 prices; sometimes I see some reformatted, obscure price info nested in script (non-html) code--page_source does this I believe)

driver.page_source (was using this method before)
driver.page_source after waiting for a deeply nested element, i.e. one of the result containers ('//[div[@data-resultid]')
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//body').get_attribute('outerHTML')
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//body').get_attribute('innerHTML')
driver.execute_script(""return document.body.innerHTML"")
there are no relevant iframes that I can see. I've switched to both iframe 1 and 2 and I see no relevant content, though I could be something wrong here.

The selenium API is pretty bad.  Is there really no equivalent to `.text` that will just give me all the HTML? That's all I want is just the source of the current page and beautifulsoup can take care of the rest.  I also really feel like the webdriver/webelement object contains this info.  At this very moment, I'm staring at 52 prices in the `.text` results, yet even when I search for the html attribute from the driver I don't see them. And as I mentioned, this is running headful, so when I inspect the source in the browser of course I do see what I'm looking for (though attributes and names change in some ways, anti-scraping measures?)  I can provide code if needed, though my bet it's my ignorance about something that is obvious to those in the know.

How to get out of shadowban.,"Hi everyone!
I'm trying to scrape a site. It's completely dynamic - the page source contains only a bunch of scripts and the text ""Turn on scripts, dummy"", so I'm using Selenium. Everything seemed to be okay until I got shadowbanned. There are no error messages, 404s or 403s, nothing like that. The page itself loads just fine, the site just doesn't provide any data for my requests.
It's not a surprise since the first versions of my script weren't utilizing any masquerading techniques. But now I've implemented everything I could think of - a random user agent, request headers matching that user agent, rotating proxies, and a bunch of fingerprint spoofing browser extensions. Nothing works. Just nothing. The site somehow knows that it's me and redirects me to the data input page. 
The same URL that fails on the server where I scrape the site works just fine on my personal machine. I have no idea what to do except drop my server and pick a new one.",9,2024-01-13 14:29:11

Help - Scraping X/Twitter,"Fellow redditors,
I humbly ask for your support in the following issue.
I am currently working on a linguistics project examining political speech on Twitter/X. One major issue I have encountered is creating a corpus of tweets/posts. 
This is why I am looking for a scraper that would allow me to extract content (text with/without media such as pictures, with/without retweets) of a single user for a definable period of time (e.g. March 2022-August 2023). Obviously if there is a tool out there that would allow for further breakdown of the data (extract hashtags, time of posting, device, etc.) that would be even better, but the bare minimum of text and date would be sufficient.
I have next to no experience coding or programming, in other words the tool should be easy to use or some sort of ""manual"" should be avaiable to get myself acquainted with it. 
Feel free to suggest other workarounds if you happen to know of any other (other than paying X/Twitter)

[Help Request] Missing elements on a page,"Hi all,
I'm pretty new to webscraping generally. Also, I don't really have any background in webdev or anything like that (I'm an economist), so if I misname anything or don't refer to things correctly, I apologise. I've been trying to do some data collection for my PhD work and am running into an issue that I can't seem to get my head around. I've consulted Stackoverflow and chatGPT but can't seem to make any headway.
The crux of the issue is: I'm trying to scrape a website of services that people offer, that contains their user profiles and a host of information related to them (location, price per hour of service, user ratings etc.). For reference, I'm doing it in R Selenium as the page is dynamically generated and scraping involves cycling through different pages on the website, and selecting/clicking on bits of the page. My background is in R, because I mainly do statistics/econometrics work - though I can limp along in Python as well. 
The issue I'm running into is: 

The page can load a max. of 1,000 query results loading 20 at a time. Great. I write a script that takes the n number of returned queries and triggers the dynamic scroll the appropriate number of times to load all queries.
I write up a couple of lines that find the elements for userID. I extract them. I get a vector of N userIDs. 
I then write up a couple of lines that find the elements for the price per hour. I extract them. I get a vector of prices. 

However... not all users provide a price per hour. So now, I end up with a vector of 1,000 user names, but only a vector 995 prices, and I have no idea where they become misaligned. When I manually check to see the profiles that don't contain prices, they simply do not contain the HTML class that relates to prices (as if it were empty, I'd just write something to impute an NA).
My next approach was to try and forloop over the profiles themselves. So I run a findElement function for the profiles, assign to an object, and then for every profile in profiles I do a findElement for the prices and check length of HTML class 'price' and if >0 getElementText, if <= 0, then NA. The problem with this, is that for some reason I get ALL the text from the profile, not just the price. This sucks for 2 reasons, a) it is inefficient and runs very slowly (and I want to scrape the entire site, so this wouldn't be feasible) and b) it then requires a lot of data processing at the end to extract specific price information from the wall of text it has extracted. 
Does anyone know of any workarounds for this kind of thing? 
Much obliged!",0,2024-01-11 14:28:21

The structure of the page is the following:
• There is the most outer that contain basically any information I need, which I was able top identify with the following snippet:
```
Only One with this classed
main_div = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME,""//div[@class='am-appointments am-section']"")

```
for child_div in child_divs:
appointments=child_div.find_elements(By.XPATH,""//div[@class='am-appointments-list']//div[@class='el-collapse']//div[contains(@class, 'el-collapse-item am-appointment am-back-appointment') or contains(@class, 'el-collapse-item am-appointment am-front-appointment')]"")

I created again a list of all the inside each child_div, and ran again the loop, to find and extract the phone number from a < span> that has the following features:

<span class=""am-appointment-data-phone"">+393314569013</span>

Even though the I am targeting in this final step is the only item with this class, the script doesn't print anything. So I guess somehow doesn't get assigned to the variable 'phone_text'. The < span> I am targeting is part of an animation, you click the button, the module expands and it's visible, or maybe there's some interference with Javascript ?

"Very small daily Twitter scrape - best way? OK with python, small amount of JS, or no-code.","Hi all
I'm looking to do a daily scrape of say, 10-20 accounts, and collect tweets from the past 24hrs from each one. I think this should not add up to many requests (?).
I feel I could almost do this manually, as the intention is to feed this into an LLM for some analysis each day (and eventually I will have a nice piece of research). But the LLM doesn't necessarily require the scrape to be amazingly formatted as JSON...  I think could just about load the page, do a text copy, paste into .txt, then send to the LLM.
However that's a little boorish and I'd rather do something more elegant!
Obviously API access is an issue these days.And not sure also if I need to be logged in to do this (probably on a new account so I don't brick mine?).
Many one-click or no-code solutions are simply WAY too expensive for my small test case here...
So I am looking for recommendations for a tool or tool stack/combo that could do this, or even run automated each day without me needing to specifically kick it off.
​
I've looked into a few (can't name them here?).
Many other tools and guides are simply way of out date, from before Musk killed the API.
​
Thanks for your advice and recommendations.
​
## Update 1 ##
I think I was specifically looking for a twitter solution, but I might be better served diving deeper into what no-code/low-code scraping solutions exist.
​
## Update 2 ##
I'm surprised there are no AI solutions either! Apparently now with LLM models with vision (am I allowed to say the obvious one?) you can easily scrape sites behind logins because it's analysing a screencap and extracting the structure and text. 
Also, how do the free chrome extensions go? Seems like this could also be small-scale enough for me to use. Not like I'm trying to sneaker-bot and need incredibly large number of calls and robust filtering.",4,2024-01-10 12:35:32

Find where headers are being added to Ajax Request,"I am trying to recreate an HTTP request through Python Requests but it looks like there are headers being added to the Ajax Request on the page that is validated server-side. Resending the same request (that worked previously) causes an error to be returned so the headers are important.
Here is the website I am trying to login to.
I was able to find the code that sends the POST request:
var b = ""/entreg/json/AuthenticateAction"";
var a;
var c = {
    username: d.username,
    password: d.password,
    newPassword: d.newPassword,
    retypeNewPassword: d.retypeNewPassword
};
$.ajax({
    url: b,
    cache: false,
    type: ""post"",
    data: $(""#loginForm"").serialize()
})

Even when I run this code by itself, it sends the request and adds the headers (all prefixed with X-jFuguZWB-). It looks like there is some obfuscated code that runs something like $.ajaxSetup({headers: {""X-jFuguZWB-Z"": ""test-value""}}) to attach that header to all requests.
My question is, which part of the page is adding these headers and is there any way to recreate the headers when I make my own POST request via Python?
I did find some obfuscated javascript in the <!-- Google Tag Manager --> section of the page but I am unable to tell what it is doing.",1,2024-01-09 22:42:04

My question is, could I get into trouble for using data from IMDB and making money? I've come across mixed opinions on this issue.

How to bypass nuData / nuDetect Anti-bot,"NuData, a subsidiary of Mastercard, integrates with 3DS verification and features an anti-bot system called nuDetect, similar to Akamai's reliance on human behavioral analysis.
Understanding nuData's Functionality
nuData operates through a website's domain or server, using a fingerprinting script found in URLs containing /init/js/ or /sync/js/. For instance, Kohls.com uses the following URL for nuData integration: https://fc.kohls.com/2.2/w/w-552128/sync/js/, utilizing a customer ID for request identification.
The configuration of nuData is stored in a pageModeConfig property, and its fingerprinting script initializes a window property at window.ndsapi.
nuData's Initial Analysis Process
nuData examines various properties, such as:

pageX, pageY coordinates of page elements, including the main document.
Scroll positions: document.body.scrollLeft & document.body.scrollRight.
Current time: Date.now(). Likely for timezone calculation.
Numerous Math operations, likely assessing the JavaScript VM.
Common properties like window._phantom, window.callPhantom, window.__phantomas, etc.
Screen details: window.screen.width, window.screen.height, window.screen.colorDepth.
Flash plugin presence.
Navigator attributes, including language and device timezone.
WebGL parameters:


VERSION RENDERER SHADING_LANGUAGE_VERSION DEPTH_BITS MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS MAX_VERTEX_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS MAX_VARYING_VECTORS MAX_VERTEX_UNIFORM_VECTORS MAX_COMBINED_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE MAX_CUBE_MAP_TEXTURE_SIZE NUM_COMPRESSED_TEXTURE_FORMATS MAX_RENDERBUFFER_SIZE MAX_VIEWPORT_DIMS ALIASED_LINE_WIDTH_RANGE ALIASED_POINT_SIZE_RANGE

Canvas fingerprinting and font metrics, using a specific script to draw and analyze text on a canvas using the following script:

​
        var b = document.createElement(""canvas"");
        b.width = 200;
        b.height = 40;
        b.style.display = ""inline"";
        var c = b.getContext(""2d"");
        c.fillText(""aBc#$efG~ \ude73\ud63d"", 4, 10);
        c.fillStyle = ""rgba(67, 92, 0, 0.5)"";
        c.font = ""18pt Arial"";
        c.fillText(""aBc#$~efG \ude73\ud63d"", 8, 12);
        a = b.toDataURL()

Behavioral Analysis by nuData
nuData tracks all page events, including keyboard (keyCode) and mouse movements (pageX, pageY), logging the sequence and timing of these events. This data suggests analysis of user interaction speed. The collected data is encoded in a proprietary format, for example: ""vce"":""apvc,0,656p336o,2,1;fg,0,;zz,153,24r,2sn,;zzf,5r8,0..."".
Bypassing nuData
Bypassing nuData security requires a nuanced approach very much like bypass Akamai (https://reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/186jdhk/how_to_bypass_akamai/), especially considering its reliance on GPU rendering information to determine the operating system and device type. 
Here are some strategies:

GPU Rendering: Emulate consumer-grade GPUs rather than professional hardware, as nuData's algorithms are tuned to recognize and differentiate between them.
Behavioral Analysis: Utilize tools like ghost-cursor (found at https://npmjs.com/package/ghost-cursor) to simulate human-like cursor movements and keystrokes. Timing is crucial here; movements or keystrokes that are too rapid can be flagged as suspicious.

Anti-bots are a growing issue among web scrapers, especially given how complex bypass can be for beginners. If you are struggling with nuData, come say hi on the Web Scraping & Data Extraction discord server!

How To Replace Expired Cookies,"Scraping noob here.
I am using python to scrape websites with known bot detection by finding the exact endpoint I want data from and creating a request in python for that endpoint. Simple enough and it is working for a majority of my use cases. 
For a few of the websites certain cookies are required. Some of these cookies seem to expire over time for different reasons. I've recently been experimenting with using residential proxies and that does in fact cause the cookies to last longer.  
How can I either
A) make one set of cookies last forever (I feel like this is impossible)
B) replace the expired cookies with new cookies
My question then becomes how can I replace the cookies?
- Should I find the exact requests that create these cookies and reproduce those?
or
- Should I try using selenium to retrieve all the expiring cookies and then use the requests I currently have in place? 
I can put in the work to find the exact cookies that actually need to be replaced.

If you open the link there are two tables, one with Squad misc stats and another with Player misc stats below it. I want the latter. I tried using BeautifulSoup and only the Squad misc table was extracted which I don't need.
So if anyone can help me out with a code snippet in python with BeautifullSoup or a different method altogether, it'd be really helpful. Thanks!",1,2024-01-02 15:36:41
ERR_BAD_REQUEST with axios.get(),"Hello everyone,I need to do some data collection on the HLTV team rankings for the Counter-strike game. As of December 25, 2023, the team rankings are :  Counter-Strike Ranking | World Ranking | HLTV.org . I need to have access to the complete HTML of the page so I can lookup the rank of the team ""FaZe"", for example. I am totally new to webscraping, so I tried using a GET request via axios :
const TEAM_RANKING_URL = ""https://www.hltv.org/ranking/teams/2023/december/25""
const axios = require('axios')
axios.get(TEAM_RANKING_URL) 
.then(res => console.log(res)) 
.catch(err => console.warn(err))
Unfortunately, I get the error message  AxiosError {message: 'Request failed with status code 403', name: 'AxiosError', code: 'ERR_BAD_REQUEST', config: {…}, request: ClientRequest, …} . I am running this code in node.js in VScode.
I think the issue is related to how the server accepts GET requests, i.e. they do not accept GET requests not coming from browsers. Can somebody help me connect to this website via node.js and have access to the html? Thank you
P.S. Ultimately, my goal is to be able to do stuff like document.getElementsByClassname() so I can parse through the rankings.

Help Needed: Managing Multiple Users in a Selenium Flask App Without Data Conflict,"​
Hi everyone,
I'm currently working on a Flask app that uses Selenium for web scraping. I've encountered a challenge where multiple users might be using the scraper at the same time. I'm seeking advice on how to ensure that there are no conflicts and users don't end up receiving data meant for others.
Here are some specific points I'm unsure about:

Isolation of User Sessions: How can I make sure that each user's scraping session is isolated and independent?
Data Integrity: What are the best practices to maintain data integrity so that each user gets only their data?
Scalability: As the number of users increases, what should I consider to keep the app scalable and efficient?
Error Handling: How can I effectively handle errors that might occur when multiple users are scraping simultaneously?
Resource Management: Are there any specific strategies for managing resources (like memory and processing power) when the app is under heavy load?

Any insights, code snippets, or resource links would be greatly appreciated. I'm relatively new to this, so detailed explanations or references to similar projects would be super helpful.
Here is my current flask app code
from flask import Flask, render_template, jsonify, request
import threading, string, random
from gmbscrape import Scrape

app = Flask(__name__)
data = []
def generate_secret_key(length=24):
    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    return ''.join(random.choice(characters) for i in range(length))

app.secret_key = generate_secret_key()

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        location = request.form.get('location').split("","")

        industry = request.form.get('industry')
        if (industry and location):
            scraper_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_scraper, args=(location, industry))
            scraper_thread.start()
            return render_template('index.html', submitted=True, curr_status=f""Scraping {industry} in {', '.join(location)} | May Take A Couple Minutes For Data To Appear..."")

        else:
            return render_template('index.html', submitted=False)

    return render_template('index.html', submitted=False)

@app.route('/get-data')
def get_data():
    return jsonify(data)

def run_scraper(location, industry):
    scraper = Scrape(location, industry, data)

Reselling energy prices through my own API,"I'm want to build a web scraper for energy prices in my country and resell these prices through my own API. The company responsible for calculating these prices has a monopoly (let's call them Ecorp) and are explicitly stating that ""automated extraction is not permitted"" on their webpage.
Some other facts about the situation with Ecorp:

They are publicly publishing the prices (without any login or authentication) once a day on their own website.
The prices are also available on many other websites, but as far as I know all prices are sourced from the Ecorp website, one way or another.
You can also access the energy prices through the Ecorp API that is quite costly to gain access to.

What I'm reading from different sources is that publicly available data that is not protected (with auth mechanisms) is free for all, but I'm very curious in this case since Ecorp are explicitly saying scraping is not permitted and they are reselling the data through their own API today.
Obviously they wouldn't be happy if I started selling this data too, but am I doing something illegal?

Issues with LinkedIn li_at Cookie Expiration During Automation,"Hello fellow web scrapers,
I'm encountering a problem with LinkedIn automation using Playwright and custom scripts. Previously, adding the li_at cookie to the context allowed smooth operations from cloud services like AWS Lambda. Typically, the cookie lasted a few weeks unless I logged in again. However, I'm now facing a challenge where a freshly obtained cookie expires almost immediately after one or two brief uses in the cloud.
Attempts to use a residential proxy (specifically from Smartproxy) failed, as I couldn't access the login page. I suspect the issue might relate to logging in from Germany but running the scrape from a data center IP in a different location. Any advice or suggestions to overcome this cookie expiration problem would be greatly appreciated!",1,2023-12-28 19:57:08

But the only way is through your history and I currently don't have an account.
I might make an account in the future but right now I need to do my reading history with the urls i know instead.
The thing I was trying to do was to make it so that I'd give the extension I'm using (webscraper.io) the Url of the fanfiction I read and the extension would scrape the data I want (title, fandom, word count, etc) from every URL I give it instead of from a reading history like how they do in the post I linked above.
I don't know how to do this though, I tried to make a sitemap with a fanfiction url and made various selector with text and it worked for that fanfiction. But then there is no way to give it a different url and make it work for another fanfiction.
I explained myself like shit i'm sorry I'm just really not familiar with these things.
Basically I want something where I enter the URL and it gives me back the data I want (since all of the urls are organized the same way and from the same site), so like a sitemap but i can change the url each time.

How to scrape Amazon pages through a flutter mobile app,"First, let me tell you I'm newbie to the scraping world and still trying to learn the basic best practices.
I've setup a very basic scraping backend example with Playwright and have verified I'm able to extract some info from an Amazon product page. 
For some reasons I'd like to see if I can make the scraping algo works on the frontend, inside the mobile app which I am developing with flutter. I am not sure how to use headless browser or a library like Playwright in this case. I only see basic examples which use basic interfaces from http package which would not work since I need the whole page and not the initial html code. Also, seems like I am not detected like a human while doing that and can't get any meaningful html response.
​
For example, I'd like to show the reviews and the rating of an Amazon product inside my app. One way to do that is to have a backend scraping server with proxies and a database, crawl the pages, fill-in the database and return the info to the user. The second way is to directly scrape inside the mobile app and show the info with no backend service, database and proxies needed. I'd like to understand if the second approach can be done at all. I'd like to evaluate both and decide which one to use based on cost and performance.",2,2023-12-20 15:13:43

Advice with amazons waf (invisible) and intelligent threat javascript.,"I used to scrape a website via http requests to an endpoint - I then parse the JSON file that is returned.

HTTP requests now fail and returns a message ""...enable javascript...""

For this reason, it's been difficult to use just regex patterns to find email, phone, address, ect. I thought I could connect a gpt api to my script, which can then analyze html data. The problem is, it seems to be running out of tokens to do this. Any advice?",1,2023-12-17 01:08:26

Need Help with Python Script for Downloading Images from Tumblr Blog,"Hi everyone,
I'm working on a Python script to download all images from a specific Tumblr blog. The script successfully downloads some images, but it's not capturing all of them. The blog has about 705 posts, and my script is only downloading images from about 442 of these.
Here's a brief overview of what I've done:

Used the Tumblr API to fetch posts (handling both 'photo' and 'text' posts).
Extracted image URLs from the posts and downloaded them.
Added logic to handle pagination and rate limits of the Tumblr API.

However, I'm facing challenges with:

The script is not downloading all images, possibly missing images from certain post types or embedded in non-standard ways.
Ensuring that it captures all types of images (like those embedded within text posts or styled with CSS).

I'm looking for advice on how to ensure the script downloads all images, including those embedded in different formats or post types. Any insights, suggestions, or code snippets would be greatly appreciated!
Here's a snippet of my script for reference:
import requests
import re
​
# ... [other parts of script] ...
​
def download_images_from_post(post):
# Logic to handle different post types
if 'photos' in post:
for photo in post['photos']:
download_image(photo['original_size']['url'], create_filename(post.get('caption', '')))
elif post['type'] == 'text' and 'body' in post:
for image_url in re.findall(r'<img\[\^>]+src=""([^"">]+)""', post['body']):
download_image(image_url, create_filename(post.get('caption', '')))
​
def download_image(image_url, filename):
# Function to download the image
response = requests.get(image_url, stream=True)
if response.status_code == 200:
with open(filename, 'wb') as out_file:
shutil.copyfileobj(response.raw, out_file)

# ... [API request and pagination logic] ...

If you look at the browser there is a ""Verifying"" spinner that never completes and all subsequent requests fail. I am not too experienced in scraping so not sure if there is a way to get around this. I can provide some code snippets if that helps.

Puppeteer: Development without getting blocked?,"I want to scrape this site: https://www.immobilienscout24.at/regional/tirol/wohnung-mieten

How to prevent this?  
I saw a few recommended proxy servers, but I'm currently not willing to pay for a proxy, at least while in development. I could also use a vpn like proton vpn or UrbanVPN but even there after reopening it to many times i need to switch my vpn to another country so my ip is different.

How to Bypass Akamai,"Akamai is renowned for its advanced anti-bot and anti-scraping solutions, widely adopted by major websites like Nike.com. The effectiveness of Akamai lies in its sophisticated approach that combines traditional fingerprinting techniques with behavioral analysis. This analysis involves tracking the JavaScript events that are triggered during a user's interaction with the website.
Recognizing Akamai
To identify Akamai's presence on a website, look for these characteristics:

Endpoint Structure: Akamai typically operates without external servers, sending data to an endpoint on the website's domain. These endpoints are characterized by long, random character paths that change with every new page load. Each endpoint typically ends with a seven-character string, comprising a mix of random lowercase and uppercase letters. Example from Nike.com:

​
https://www.nike.com/-V9sK5EuHw5zf/s5azPS0VO0/SGj4/3z9ifbmQLb/M0lvcEBEAQ/a0tSI/UgeeikB


Sensor Data:  Akamai sends a key JSON payload named sensor_data to these endpoints. This data is encoded or encrypted using a proprietary algorithm, making it distinct and recognizable. Example payload from Nike.com:

​
{""sensor_data"":""2;4337974;4473908;15,0,0,0,2,0;E9_ 4*o9=r]a0cpl4wxD!z/b4xhdXjOQD4`,=D{bOJjj4:Ob&oj?(6D UK8,-@2;{*U1@Y2jjl+*Uu8=cbeB#HC$]^HeXmd%sZFm5K3rwzDK{=iw;HV}d;J+hn]wr43Y6F}[Q,TF&~?v*V3:q~+jbv7&jh])6JT^wcQF](wf|vPkOrG_(3QG>],jMSj/!Na*w>rh3]WAcv8YMnC) IJJBZKF8E9iPXh2)gmsEmv`@QSY?d:%0KgTC&R9Bj3ZqGX7>=9f2rjbf=X>.SExZq45>i1FGWkIf-Cl8]BL2ffk2g1l_8%aG^=5: Q[ct?Y*m(f%MFU}hlxNq[68ejD&W~27%jru9N5[>bJ[5;B~f|~i!sU^54s_0g}$w[_fDt<*R-v3by%gUu#d1w`Q52K2Y=`z[KevKiU*#X8X9HWG2hnUd`{q`jR[%q$M@$Si;l^.{iR$Sx&(~-W;z}l%q)lpP6Q}pd(E/RF+}dO8n,@M.n5|MhZgk}euOJqC5=^...""}


Cookies: Akamai set the following cookies on the client browser:


_abck
ak_bmsc
bm_mi
bm_sz
bm_sv


Akamai's Device Fingerprinting
Akamai extensively uses techniques like Canvas Fingerprinting and WebGL fingerprinting to identify user devices. This is achieved using JavaScript, as illustrated in the provided scripts. These scripts create a unique identifier for each device based on how it renders certain elements.
var n = document.createElement(""canvas"");
if (n.width = 280,
  n.height = 60,
  n.style.display = ""none"",
  ""function"" == typeof n.getContext) {
    var o = n.getContext(""2d"");
    o.fillStyle = ""rgb(102, 204, 0)"",
      o.fillRect(100, 5, 80, 50),
      o.fillStyle = ""#f60"",
      o.font = ""16pt Arial"",
      o.fillText(t, 10, 40),
      o.strokeStyle = ""rgb(120, 186, 176)"",
      o.arc(80, 10, 20, 0, Math.PI, !1),
      o.stroke();
    var m = n.toDataURL();
    e = 0;
    for (var r = 0; r < m.length; r++) {
     e = (e << 5) - e + m.charCodeAt(r),
     e &= e
   }
   e = e.toString();

   var i = document.createElement(""canvas"");
   i.width = 16,
     i.height = 16;
   var c = i.getContext(""2d"");
   c.font = ""6pt Arial"",
     a.rVal = Math.floor(1e3 * Math.random()).toString(),
     c.fillText(a.rVal, 1, 12);
   for (var b = i.toDataURL(), d = 0, s = 0; s < b.length; s++) {
     d = (d << 5) - d + b.charCodeAt(s),
       d &= d
   }
   a.rCFP = d.toString()
}

...

try {
   var t = document.createElement(""canvas""),
     a = t.getContext(""webgl"");
       bmak.wv = ""n"",
       bmak.wr = ""n"",
       bmak.weh = ""n"",
       bmak.wl = 0,
     a && (bmak.wv = ""b"",
       bmak.wr = ""b"",
       bmak.weh = ""b"",
     a.getSupportedExtensions() && (bmak.weh = bmak.ats(bmak.mn_s(JSON.stringify(a.getSupportedExtensions().sort()))),       bmak.wl = a.getSupportedExtensions().length,       a.getSupportedExtensions().indexOf(""WEBGL_debug_renderer_info"") >= 0 && (bmak.wv = a.getParameter(a.getExtension(""WEBGL_debug_renderer_info"").UNMASKED_VENDOR_WEBGL),       bmak.wr = a.getParameter(a.getExtension(""WEBGL_debug_renderer_info"").UNMASKED_RENDERER_WEBGL)))) } catch (t) {
    bmak.wv = ""e"",
    bmak.wr = ""e"",
    bmak.weh = ""e"",
    bmak.wl = 0
 }

Akamai Behavioral Analysis
In its highest security settings, Akamai can capture multiple sensor_data payloads per minute. This includes recording various user interactions like mouse movements, clicks, touch events, and keyboard inputs. The system also tracks the positions of these events on the page.  Here is the event it is listening to:

touchmove
touchstart
touchend
touchcancel
mousemove
click
mousedown
mouseup
pointerdown
pointerup
keydown
keyup
keypress
touchmove
touchstart
touchend
touchcancel
onmousemove
onclick
onmousedown
onmouseup
onpointerdown
onpointerup
onkeydown
onkeyup
onkeypress

Bypassing Akamai
Bypassing Akamai's security requires a nuanced approach, especially considering its reliance on GPU rendering information to determine the operating system and device type.   Here are some strategies:

GPU Rendering: Emulate consumer-grade GPUs rather than professional hardware, as Akamai's algorithms are tuned to recognize and differentiate between them.
Behavioral Analysis: Utilize tools like ghost-cursor (found at https://npmjs.com/package/ghost-cursor) to simulate human-like cursor movements and keystrokes. Timing is crucial here; movements or keystrokes that are too rapid can be flagged as suspicious.

Learning how to monitor navigator and other Browser API objects,"Hi, very new to all this. Started learning Javascript and wrote a quick puppeteer script some time back to scrape. Interested to know what frameworks or software you fine folks are using to detect how Navigator and Screen API objects (as an example) are being called by heavily obfuscated telemetry scripts.

Completely new to webscraping is this possible?,"Hey guys , I'm completely new to the webscraping world and I was mainly driven here on my journey to extract data from a subreddit for marketing research purposes. I don't really quite understand how webscraping works entirely other than you have to write code. I've watched a bunch of YouTube videos as well and I've seen people extract data like posts and the comments of the post from a subreddit. However my question is, would it be possible to search for a specific keyword in the entirety of the subreddit or maybe even around like 5000 posts. would that be doable or is it a very difficult task? I also wonder if it would be possible to automate and create a bot that scans and constantly updates you if someone comments a specific word within the subreddit. Am I expecting too much? I'm asking before I invest my time into potentially learning how to code or finding someone to hire for a task like this. Would be grateful for any insight.",3,2023-11-27 23:08:10

Need some proxies or suggestions,"Hey guys,
I do quite a bit of webscraping and have all my other sites down no issues. Who all does everyone use for proxies? I’ve tried one proxy who I use for a few other sites but the cookie I had was causing it to get blocked. Local run on node JS got through with zero issues with the same cookie, and if I go with no cookie through the proxy it has zero issues as well. Good ole cloudFlare has this site locked down tighter than most I’ve seen with bot checks often. All cookies are encrypted as well so what each one does is hard to say. I’ve tried turning on and off each one but the moment I touch them a bot check is instant and will forever check any IP with that cookie. Like wise, I can run using puppeteer stealth all day on the website with no issues. As soon as I use that same cookie with my current proxies it’s instantly bot checked followed by any ip with that cookie also having the same issue.

Scraping McDonald's Europe,"I'd like to compose a list of all McDonald's restaurants in certain European countries.
Many countries (eg. the UK, Netherlands, Switzerland) use a common API which delivers the results as a JSON array:
https://www.mcdonalds.com/googleappsv2/geolocation?latitude=51.54&longitude=-0.15&radius=200&maxResults=150&country=gb&language=en-gb
https://www.mcdonalds.com/googleappsv2/geolocation?latitude=52.55&longitude=5.60&radius=200&maxResults=150&country=nl&language=en-nl
https://www.mcdonalds.com/googleappsv2/geolocation?latitude=46.20&longitude=6.14&radius=200&maxResults=150&country=ch&language=en-ch
The parameters should be quite self-explanatory.
But the API seems to have a upper limit regarding the ""maxResults"" parameters depending on the ""country"" parameter. While the GB call returns 150 results, the NL call only returns a subset of 38.
It seems to be a Google API. IS there any known way to bypass this behaviour?
At the moment I bypass this limitation by setting the maxresults to a low number, changing the latitude and longitude parameters by a slight margin and calling the API again and again eliminating double results afterwards. But I'm worried that I might miss results in dense areas like London or Amsterdam.

Web Scraping Legality,"TLDR: Educational website paywalls content unsuccessfully, can I re-host publicly available data? 
​
So here's the situation, there's a fairly large educational website who monetizes it's content behind a paywall. Aka some free stuff and then the rest is locked behind a paywall. They sell monthly/yearly/lifetime subscriptions.
They teach a certain web technology, the irony is their own implementation of the web technology is flawed (which ngl pisses me off). As such they have a bug in their code that allows anyone with a free account to access all their content in a relatively easy way (if you know how). The bug is reproducible and easy to exploit. I genuinely feel like I'm maybe the only person that has found this? I've searched for scrapers to this site, on GitHub, but all of them rely on having a ""premium"" account. Also their content isn't really available on pirated websites.
I reached out to them telling them that their paywalled content can be accessed via a bug (I didn't explain the steps to bypass), and after some back and forth they said they would have me talk to a developer, nothing came of it (its been months). I feel like my ethical obligation is over. 
Now how legal/illegal would it be to create a website that serves their content? I already created a pretty robust python cli that can download all their courses, and the course metadata.  I will not be downloading their videos and hosting them my self, my webapp would link to their own hosted content, so as far as I'm concerned I'm not distributing ""stolen"" content, but instead distributing links (that can be accessed publicly). 
AKA
<video src=""their-website.com/video.mp4""></video>

Would they have any grounds for legal recourse?

- @environment-safe/canvas - a fully uniform canvas that supports node + the browser
- extended-emitter - an emitter with subscription criteria
- array-events - simple array utilities
- image-booth - compares pixel outputs from image operations to canonical output
- @environment-safe/authentication - client + server auth, with a simple example of fixtures

Best solution for scraping lecture archive for academic research?,"So there is a web archive online that hosts several thousand plain text lectures and books. The text of each lecture is served up on a separate page but that text is surrounded by banners and side-bar text that I don't want to capture.
Interestingly enough,  there is a 'print/pdf' button off to the right on each lecture page and when you click there it shows just the lecture text to print. This functionality makes me think that there must be a way to scrape the entire archive and neatly save each lecture into it's own PDF automatically, rather than me having to do this by hand 3000+ times.
The catch is, I'm not a coder and I don't know what tool I could use to pull this off. Since it is a very simple website (3000+ text files served up via HTML, one file at a time), perhaps configuring a command-prompt based tool like scrapy wouldn't be the hardest thing? No clue what I'm doing here :)
The website I'm looking to archive is rsarchive.org. I'm looking to download all the lectures and books hosted there so I can build a GPT and then query the archive that way, using it as a super-charged re-search tool.

Categorize scraped products by using their title and/or description,"What I’m building
I’m making a project that uses data from different webshops to show the best prices of Pokémon products. I’m working with Nuxt 3 as my framework, and a mongo database with all the data for my products. Now what I’m trying to add is some kind of way to categorize these products by 3 properties: ‘Category’, ‘Serie’, and ‘Expansion’ without having these properties available through the webshops.
Problem summary
Different webshops all use a slightly different name/title and description for the same products. Also most of the time they don’t have their products nicely categorized.
Examples
Here are 2 examples of data I have, and what I’m trying to get from them.
// Input:
{
    title: ""Pokemon Sword & Shield Darkness Ablaze Sleeved Booster Pack"",
    description: """", //Will not alway be there
}

//Output:
{
    category: ""Booster Packs"",
    serie: ""Sword & Shield"", 
    expansion: ""Darkness Ablaze"",
}

// Input:
{
    title: ""Pokemon Charizard EX Premium"",
    description: ""Charizard ex Collection Box vernietigt de voorsprong van de tegenstander met de sluwe vuurkracht van een Darkness-type Pokémon! ... etc etc."",
}

//Output:
{
    category: ""Collection Box"", //Got from description
    serie: ""Other"", //No data
    expansion: ""Other"", //No data
}

Things I tried:

Just a simple string matching approach. So I made some arrays with categories, series, and expansions. Then just to some stuff with includes(). Got it right sometimes, wrong some times. Might be the way to go, but looking for something better for now.
I was now playing around with some NLP libraries. Like with Natural I tried to use this BayesianCalssifier()(See here) and then train it with the categories, series, and expansions. Same as above, sometimes works, sometimes no.

This is the structure of my data I was using:
const categories = [
  ""Booster Pack"",
  ""Booster Box"",
  ""Theme Deck"",
  ""Elite Trainer Box"",
  ""Special Box"",
  ""Collection Box"",
  ""Tin"",
  ""Blister Pack"",
  ""Other"",
];

const pokemonTCG = [
  {
    serie: ""EX Series"",
    expansions: [
      ""Ruby & Sapphire"",
      ""Sandstorm"",
      ""Dragon"",
      ""Team Magma vs Team Aqua"",
      ""Hidden Legends"",
      // etc..
    ],
  },
  //etc..

Some problems I ran in to with above things:

The first example I gave has this title: “Pokemon Sword & Shield Darkness Ablaze Sleeved Booster Pack”. The problem here is that “Sword & Shield” is the series, but “Sword & Shield” is also an expansion from that series. So with the things I tried I never got “Darkness Ablaze” back as the expansion.

Some other ideas I had:

Chat-GPT can do this really well it seems, but prefer first to try to get this to work for free.
Train my own model. Not sure if I want to get into that.
Manually add them.

What I’m looking for
Mainly some ideas on things to try to make this work. Is some NLP library the way to go here and I’m just not looking for the right functions? Off course if someone has been where I’m currently and figured it out, I would love to know how. Or maybe should I not try to do this at all?",1,2023-11-20 16:21:16

Getting contact information for a traditional mailing effort,"Good day, I want to offer a video service to my local 50 mile radius of Churches. The District Conference has a website where you can 'search for a Church' and a result will come back for your given zipcode. I only have 2 zipcodes to enter so the return will be two separate queries.
The results come back in 3 or 4 lines with either an email address or POC as the 4th line of the address. Usually the display will be 10 results per page and the pages can be up to 3 for the results.
I've coded as a SysAdmin in the past with Python for various taskings, but not too much in the Web arena. I'm aware of JSON but very seldomly had to parse it for results, our DevOps folks did that.
The website does not have an API that I am aware of, all the information is public facing.
My ultimate goal is to get the results and create a Database of the Church addresses, phones, POCs and email addresses.
I have access to Windows 11, MacOs and Linux PopOS and am comfortable with each. 
Grace and Peace.

Browser/proxy providers and pricing,"As I near a soft-launch of my browser as a service I have taken note that all of my competitors price their usage based on various credit systems, i.e. for $x/mo you receive 250K ""credits"" on the service. What a credit gets you depends on what you need for an individual request. For example, if just need a plain HTTP request it might be one credit, but if you need a JS render with a proxy you'll use 10. Others charge one credit per 30s of time used with additional credits consumed if you require a proxy.
For those that use these services, how does that work out for you?  I can see the usefulness of such a system in that you have one pool of resources that can be used in a variety of ways. Whether you just need unproxied non-JS renders or full proxy with JS you use the same system. On the flip side I wonder if this is viewed in any negative light amongst consumers in that it's not entirely clear how far your credits will get you and it's possible to incur overages.
I had in mind an alternative that I wanted to run by you all:
Unlimited usage, pay by concurrency 
In this system I offer unlimited usage based on concurrency. If you just need a small amount of concurrency to complete all of the scraping you need, you pay for one worker. If you have a lot to get done in the month you pay for the additional concurrency needed to complete the required tasks. It's still a scaling system in that you pay only for what you need, but it's more transparent about what you're getting and there's no possibility of overages or billing surprises. 
For proxies I was thinking this would be an add-on for a worker; a non-proxy worker costs $x/mo but a proxy enabled one adds a proxy surcharge. 
The advantage of this system is that you can use the service without concern of incurring extra charges. 
One disadvantage is you're more tied into running your requests continuously in order to take advantage of the unlimited usage, i.e. you cannot just complete all your requests at once, you have to spread them out over the month. In some way this might be a good strategy to prevent being blocked as the traffic being more steady is less likely to trip detection, but it of course depends on use case.
----
My last thread was very insightful so I look forward to hearing any feedback on this concept. Please feel free to shoot it down entirely if it's not helpful. I'm not tied to any particular system and am trying to find the best fit.",1,2023-11-17 04:12:29

"Product hidden data (Tags, ID, SKU) Scraper for e commerce","Hi, I'm new to this community and appreciate your patience. 
I'm in the process of setting up an e-commerce store specializing in hardware products. My goal is to compile a comprehensive product sheet with details like SKU numbers, IDs, tags, etc., which I can then easily import into my WooCommerce site.
I'm curious if there's a feasible method to develop a scraper that could automatically populate this sheet with the necessary data from a given product link.

However, what I'm particularly interested in is extracting the ""hidden"" data from competing e-commerce sites. I'm looking to replicate the same ID and SKU numbers so that if someone searches these on Google, there's a higher chance my store will appear in the search results. Additionally, using the same tags as larger, more SEO-savvy companies seems like a strategic move. 😄",3,2023-11-15 23:58:16

storing output and building an API to retrieve scraping results for later use
alerting and responding to DOM changes before data becomes out of date

GPT-4 vision utilities to enable web browsing,"Wanted to share our work on Tarsier here, an open source utility library that enables LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-4 Vision to browse the web. The library helps answer the following questions:

How do you map LLM responses back into web elements?
How can you mark up a page for an LLM to better understand its action space?
How do you feed a ""screenshot"" to a text-only LLM?

We do this by tagging ""interactable"" elements on the page with an ID, enabling the LLM to connect actions to an ID which we can then translate back into web elements. We also use OCR to translate a page screenshot to a spatially encoded text string such that even a text only LLM can understand how to navigate the page.

Need Advise from the community for an AI/WS Project,"Hello everyone!
So this is my first post on the community, so I'm sorry in advance if this kind of post is not either allowed or encouraged.
Anyway, I'm building a project (kinda of a pet project for fun) that I might make available for free if I'm able to implement enough interesting features. (as it involves third-party APIs, I'll probably make it so any user would just need to add his own API keys in it and of course I'll open source it so everything is transparent).
About the Project:
The project (MVP version) is basically as follow (in term of flow):
1) Log in (OAuth2).
2) Add the needed API Keys in the profile.
3)a) Subscribe to a list of websites (Mainly ""News"" or ""Engineering Blogs"") either from the existing ones or add a new one.
3)b) Subscribe to a Topic (something like ""stocks"", ""databases"", etc..).
4) At the end of each Day/Week (Depending on user preferences), be alerted (Through Email in MVP and then in other channels in future versions) on the new articles that have been added to the subscribed sources (the websites).
5) Get a compilation (on the alert email for example) of summaries (using OpenAI's APIs for now) from all the subscribed sources new articles (with links to the original articles at the bottom of each summary). That could also be something like a summary per website or per topic of interest (still thinking about it).
6) New features that I didn't thought about yet.. (Stuff like make a Read-ONLY mode of the scraped content, categorise through AI/LLMs the articles topic among existing ones etc..).
About Web-scraping:
So I've already implemented the ""Summarise one article given its URL"" (I'm scrapping the article's source using a very basic approach with JSOUP and getting all the ""post"", ""p"", ""h1, etc.. HTML elements that could contain anything relevant to be used for the summary.
However, I'm actually struggling to define the approach that I will take to kinda ""observe"" the different websites (I guess scrap each sources daily/hourly(?) to discover any new item) and then for each one scrap/parse the articles to pull the content and then summarise through LLMs APIs.
I'm also not sure if I'd need a headless browser approach here and if I should:
- build everything manually (relying on open-source libraries at the most).
- use OS frameworks like amerkurev/scrapper's one on github (or anything similar as I'm not aware of the SOA in WS).
- use APIs (and give the user to put his own API key of course) like scrapingant.
​
Anyway, I'm trying to define an approach that would scale (as much as possible as I'm not aiming for a big tech product kinda scale but robust enough to not fail once number of users starts to grow) with enough complexity to be able to support most of the website that users would want to follow/observe (I guess News/Finance/Engineering blogs/etc..).
Any idea, suggestion, opinion on the above is very much welcomed and needed !
​
BTW, I'm building the project using Java/SpringBoot but as I'm using a micro-service approach so It would be able to code the ""observer"" / ""scraper"" components in other languages if you guys think of something more suitable/efficient with something else than Java.

Open source evaluations for AI Agents in web tasks,"Recently created Banana-lyzer, an open source AI Agent evaluation framework and dataset for web tasks with Playwright (And has a banana theme because why not) and would love to get feedback/support. There are a few issues with existing evals repos:

Websites change overtime, are affected by latency, and may have anti bot protections. We need a system that can reliably save and deploy historic/static snapshots of websites.
Standard web practices are loose and there is an abundance of different underlying ways to represent a single individual website. For an agent to best generalize, we require building a diverse dataset of websites across industries and use-cases.
We have specific evaluation criteria and agent use cases focusing on structured and direct information retrieval across websites.
There exists valuable web task datasets and evaluations that we'd like to unify in a single repo (Mind2Web, WebArena, etc).

Headless returns different results,"Background : I’ve been pulling json data via a 3rd party API for years using php/curl and it’s stopped working. When I turn on verbose I can see it’s failing due to HTTP/2 stream not closed properly - internal
Error.
The odd thing is if I just call the link with chrome the JSON appears.. so I thought I’d go headless to get the data.. but when I use the exact same chrome browser but with —headless (and optionally no gpu) it returns nothing, just like when I call with Curl.
So the question is..  what’s different? Does the non headless version show something that’s not picked up/ returned by directing the headless output to a file? Am I missing a setting? The API is used via jquery on the .red party website and seems to work fine there",2,2023-11-09 18:32:39
Detect if there are new products available on a website,"Hi everybody!
I am developing a Node.js app that utilizes web scraping to retrieve products published today from multiple websites. The idea is to run this script once or twice a day using an Azure function and receive notifications about these new products. The problem is that I am scraping the entire list of products from each website because they don't have a filter that shows only the ""published today"" ones. As a result, I am getting around 50 products per website when I should only be getting 4 or 5.
I am considering saving all the products in a database. If I try to save a product and can do so because it doesn't already exist in the database, it will be saved with today's date. After the entire saving process, I can retrieve the ones with the ""createdAt"" field equal to today's date and notify the user.
Is this a valid approach? I would prefer to avoid using databases if possible because I want to minimize time-consuming operations, but if there is no other way, it is okay. Do you have any ideas? Thank you!",1,2023-11-09 22:17:02
scrapy-impersonate: Scrapy download handler that can impersonate browser' TLS signatures or JA3 fingerprints.,"Hello everyone!
I wanted to share with you a tool I've been working on lately and found very useful: scrapy-impersonate. If you're conducting web scraping with Scrapy, this tool allows you to emulate TLS signatures or JA3 fingerprints of specific browsers. This will help you be less detectable, which can be useful when attempting to scrape some sites protected by Cloudflare.
​
What is scrapy-impersonate?
Is a Scrapy download handler. This project integrates curl_cffi to perform HTTP requests, so it can impersonate browsers' TLS signatures or JA3 fingerprints.
​
How to use it?
Is relatively straightforward if you're already familiar with Scrapy. Simply integrate it as your download handler and configure the browser signature you wish to impersonate. You'll be all set to make HTTP requests, impersonating browser signatures.
import scrapy


class ImpersonateSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = ""impersonate_spider""
    custom_settings = {
        ""DOWNLOAD_HANDLERS"": {
            ""http"": ""scrapy_impersonate.ImpersonateDownloadHandler"",
            ""https"": ""scrapy_impersonate.ImpersonateDownloadHandler"",
        },
        ""TWISTED_REACTOR"": ""twisted.internet.asyncioreactor.AsyncioSelectorReactor"",
    }

    def start_requests(self):
        for browser in [""chrome110"", ""edge99"", ""safari15_5""]:
            yield scrapy.Request(
                ""https://tls.browserleaks.com/json"",
                dont_filter=True,
                meta={""impersonate"": browser},
            )

    def parse(self, response):
        # ja3_hash: 773906b0efdefa24a7f2b8eb6985bf37
        # ja3_hash: cd08e31494f9531f560d64c695473da9

Scrape the DBA name,"How could we scrape out something specific from a website?

Resolving recaptchas when form submit button is disabled,"So i have a problem. I have singed up for 2captcha service recently and i have tested it on googles recaptcha demo page and it works perfectly. But when I go to site i actually want to scrape i need to log in and i get the form with username, password and recaptcha. The submit button for the form is disabled by default and it is enabled after solving recaptcha (manually). I use selenium to populate those fields and to find all the data i need to send to 2captcha. After that i get the token in response which I put in that hidden textarea ""g-recaptcha-response"" but the button remains disabled. What do i need to do? I have tried just enabling and clicking the button but i get access denied. What could be happening when i manually solve the captcha that makes the button clickable? Should i somehow send a request to google so they would verify my captcha? Or maybe there are some javascript events i should trigger?

How to Use Headers When Reading JSON URL?,"Hi all! Thanks in advance for any guidance. I'm trying to read a JSON url in Python. When I open the url in chrome, I can see the data, but when I read it in python, I get {'error': 'Unauthorized'}. When I open the url in Edge, I get the same error. I determined it was because I have to be logged in to the website through my gmail account, and then I can see the JSON data. When I inspect the site's Network, I see a request called Session that contains the following (I changed some of the personal details): 
{
""user"": {
    ""email"": ""ekraft@gmail.com"",
    ""sub"": ""58edee6c-e210-4f2c-99a2-568efde67a6a"",

Web Crawling JS heavy websites,"Hi, so I’m having a problem with the following task. Given an arbitrary site ‘url’ I want to be able to find all its sub-links given a specified depth, and then get the HTML content of each of those sub-links including the given site.
I’ve been trying to use Scrapy’s Crawlspider to find all sublinks, which has been pretty successful. However, I’m facing a problem parsing whenever the site is JS heavy. I want to use Playwright’s Scrapy-Playwright extension to address the issue, however I’m having trouble integrating it with CrawlSpider.
Has anyone done anything similar, or got any tips?
Thanks!

How to scrape a GraphQL endpoint that uses Apollo,"​
I was trying to get some data from this website, the Apollo dev tools extension works in that it returns some results, but I couldn't figure out a way to do it programmatically. When I use the Apollo dev tools, what is the url that the queries are going to? Is it just the page that your current tab is on? And how does the extension send the requests?
This is the extension page, and whenever I run the query, I can see a graphql.json being POSTed with a unique cipher and token field. The server also returned with a cipher and token in its response. 
Does anyone know how the payload is hashed? Is it possible to send this request some other way using a request API of python or something?

Yet another starter questions thread,"Ok not so starter but I finally hit a wall in my web scraping journey and learned the basics of requests, BS4, Selenium (Just a quick and dirty Project), and Playwright.
1 - Requests:  I've found the requests that the website uses to show the data but sometimes can't manipulate it using another request to get the data back, in this case, how can I improve my requesting skills?
2 - Performance/Speed:  I can use a Headless browser but the scraping speed is slower, for doing commercial work is this acceptable? (Taking into account that the client will run the scripts)
3 - Running on other machines: Which is easier to package and make run on another machine with PyInstaller  (Are the alternative methods ?)

Adding Proxy to existing Scraper,"Hello everyone,
because I'm not a developer, I took this project https://github.com/sandra-liedtke/ti_scraper to help me.
With a little adaptation, I now have a scraper running on my Raspberry that collects articles from selected news sites every hour and sends a summary to me by email.
Now I would like to query a news site more frequently, e.g. every minute. But then I get blocked. I would like to use proxies to get around this (be it free or commercial service providers). 
The only question is: How do I implement the use of a proxy service provider, which has to provide itself with a new IP after every call or every minute?
Or is there another tool with which I can check a specific news page for content at freely selectable intervals?

What would be the best way to webscrape multiple websites for recipes?,"So I'm making a ""Recipe Finder"" website (mainly for a project to put on a resume) and since I'm interested in cooking, I thought a good project would be to make a website where you can select different ingredients that you have available (e.g. chicken breast + paprika + flour) and it would list all of the recipes from numerous websites that contain those ingredients.
I've never really done webscraping before, so I'm unsure how to go about it. Just thinking about it, individually having to webscrape 10s of different websites to gather all their recipes doesn't seem efficient, but I'm unsure how else to do it. 
So yeah, anyone have any advice on how to go about doing it? I'll probably be using AngleSharp for C# (I know, it'd be way better if I used Python).

"Instruments, Packages, etc. for parsing 10-X filings for Schedule(s) of Investments?","I have a select group of SEC 10-X (10-Q and 10-K primarily) filings I want to look at but I've been running into issues for the past several months with trying to parse the Schedule of Investments from these filings. My approach has been very... raw in that It's mostly just taking the .txt files and parsing them with BS4 and using a lot of shoddy logic to try and isolate the right tables before extracting and cleaning everything.   
Issue is, especially pre-2009, formatting is hella wonky. It's so inconsistent that I can't hardly come up with a good way to semi-consistently scrape the info I need. I need to do this for the statement of operations as well as the statement of assets and liabilities as well, but the schedule of investments is honestly more of a priority and has given me a lot more grief.   
Are there any packages I should be making use of that would make this more feasible, or better yet is this something that's already been done that I can look at for reference?? (I'll need to customize the code a bit for my own sake, but it would still save a lot of hours lol).   
Also, before anyone says anything, yeah I've considered going to vendors but the issue is that a good handful of the filings I'm using actually pre-date what pretty much any vendors I've looked at actually have, so it wouldn't be all that helpful in the grand scheme of things. Plus I want to be able to see this through and have something reproducible at the end instead of just ""go buy this"".   
I've tried looking around to see if anyone has already managed to craft code for this purpose, but everything either seems to make use of a format other than the .txt files I've downloaded (the HTML), or they are extracting something more akin to header information, etc. which is not what I'm after.",1,2023-11-01 22:10:54

Looking for tips on cheerio.js (css) selectors for prices on webshop detail pages,"I'm working on a scraping tool that scrapes multiple web shops. I'm scraping all sorts of data but for this question it's about returning a `currentPrice` and a optional `originalPrice` (if there is a sale). Off course all these websites have different structures so i pass in my selectors depending on the web shop I'm scraping. For a lot of websites this works fine, but some make my life a little bit harder. Some scenario's i come across:
- Different structure when product has a single price vs a product that is on sale- All kinds of hidden elements with prices in them- Sometimes even different structures for product detail pages within 1 web shop.
Maybe I'm just shit at making (CSS) selectors, or maybe i should be changing other things then my selectors, but i wanted to see if maybe someone here has tips for me on how to do it.
Here are some examples.
Product detail page with single price (https://www.bescards.nl/pokemon-battle-deck-tinkaton-ex/):
<div class=""wd-single-price wd-wpb text-left"">
    <p class=""price"">
    <span class=""woocommerce-Price-amount amount"">
        <bdi>
        <span class=""woocommerce-Price-currencySymbol"">€</span>18,99
        </bdi>
    </span>
    <small class=""woocommerce-price-suffix""> incl. btw</small>
    </p>
</div>

Product detail page with sale price (https://www.bescards.nl/pokemon-charizard-ex-premium-collection-box/):
<div class=""wd-single-price wd-wpb text-left"">
<p class=""price"">
    <del aria-hidden=""true"">
        <span class=""woocommerce-Price-amount amount"">
            <bdi>
                <span class=""woocommerce-Price-currencySymbol"">€</span>50,00
            </bdi>
        </span>
    </del>
    <ins>
        <span class=""woocommerce-Price-amount amount"">
            <bdi>
                <span class=""woocommerce-Price-currencySymbol"">€</span>39,99
            </bdi>
        </span>
    </ins>
    <small class=""woocommerce-price-suffix""> incl. btw</small>
 </p>
</div>    

Or this is another shop that does stuff weird with hidden divs:https://www.debroergrot.nl/products/pokemon-tcg-paldea-evolved-pawmot-premium-1-pack-blister (single price)https://www.debroergrot.nl/products/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-paldea-evolved-booster-pack (sale)
I even got to the point where i was concidering other things, but since i don't see anyone do this i'm not sure these are the way:

Use openai API to ask it giving it a bigger piece of DOM (chatGPT seems to get it right every time)
Passing in a bigger portion of the DOM to a custom script that searches/filters for prices (hard with hidden stuff)
Creating some kind of machine learning thing myself
Taking a screenshot and getting the prices from there.

No quick scraping option for this task?,"Hey, I'm newer to the world of programming and computational work (I'm in the social sciences), and I'm currently tasked with overseeing a project where we need gather all of the youtube links that congress members share on their websites to help with a political science research project we're doing. Many of these sites have a news/press release section where there will be a page that will display the top 5 or 10 most recent updates, then you can click next to the next page of 5-10 more  posts and so on. Some of these sites are pretty quick and can have one person click through all of the press releases pretty quickly to snag any of the youtube urls, but then there are others that literally have over 6,000 press releases to click through which takes a massive amount of manhours. The problem is that we need to do this for each congressional website which are all different, so we can't really build a one-size fits all webscraper for the task, so the thought right now is to just apply for a grant to get a bunch of undergrads to hammer away at the mindless tasks of going through all of the pages manually. This is also because out team does not have anyone particularly experienced with webscraping, though a few are quite experienced in other computational processes.   
However, I just wanted to check and see if we might be missing a more efficient way of doing this. I just spent an hour or two trying to see if the Scraper and WebPilot plugins for GPT-4 might be able to handle the task of iteratively gathering youtube links from those pages like we need, but it was way too buggy to actually work. Is there some other expedited or releatively efficient way (i.e., some tool or tutorial you'd recommend) for someone like me with only minimul python experience to be able to craft a scraper for each site within a couple of hours, or would it likely take 5+ hours for someone of my skill level to get to the end result of the links I want from each site?

Currently, I’m awaiting API keys from the advert site to enrich the Telegram alerts with the advert owner’s phone number. It’s hosted on EC2, and he’ll cover the hosting costs. He also wants ongoing maintenance like adding new advert links and compatibility with new advert sites.
I’m unsure how to charge him for the initial setup and for future improvements since this is new territory for me. Can you share your pricing strategies or any advice on this? Thanks!",6,2023-10-27 10:27:56
Selenium Python Help,"Hi, I'm new to coding and I am learning python. As my first real project I am creating a room reservation bot that can reserve practice/ study rooms at my university using python and Selenium. So far the code can log me and navigate to the time selection page but I have encountered an issue here.
There are two drop down menus for the reservation start time and reservation end time with unique names, but the individual time slots are shown like this.  
<select id=""EndPeriod"" name=""endPeriod"" class=""form-control  input-sm inline-block timeinput"" title=""End time"">
<option value=""00:30:00"">12:30 AM</option>
<option value=""01:00:00"">1:00 AM</option>
<option value=""01:30:00"">1:30 AM</option>
ect... for all 24 hours in 30 min blocks. 
​
How can I search for viable text within a drop down menu, since the values for each list are identical and I can click on the drop down to expose the text,  or search for the Value = in Selenium? I've tried a lot of solutions online but none have been helpful.

"Need help accessing ""div""-class with requests or HTMLSession","Hi everyone
I'm just starting out with webscraping and python as a fun side project and need help. What I'm trying to do here is to get all the new threads from the community hub for Star Citizen announcements. 
This is how far I've come so far:
Code
``` python

page = requests.get(""https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1?page=1&sort=hot"")
soup = BeautifulSoup(page.text, ""html.parser"")
print(soup.body)
```
Output
html

Simple methods to scrape product images from search results/links on ordinary e-commerce sites?,"Hi, I was wondering if there are simple or tried-and-tested methods to scrape product images from ordinary (not mainstream) e-commerce sites?
For background, I'm looking into e-com sites where:

You can search for products according to categories/tags which leads to a generic search results page.
Search results page url contains the category tag/id and page number.
Clicking on X product will bring you X product's main page where there are product photos of each angle, where you can get its direct link if you open it in a new tab. These are the photos I want to scrape.

I'm more interested in the general process or concept of the methods.. I'm guessing since all you need are the LINKS, hopefully someone could help point out the common direction to gather these links for image scraping.
I'd like to know if can be done with little to no code or at least the confirm the fact that built in tools already exist so I don't have to reinvent the wheel.
TIA!

Need Help Improving Web Scraping Speed & Process,"Objective:
Scrape a specific product's webpage frequently (1-2 times per second) to detect new adverts. Once detected, notify my client via Telegram.
Current Setup: 
- Using Axios + Cheerio for scraping.
- Employing a residential proxy.
Issue: 
When my client gets the Telegram notification and opens the advert link, the phone number is hidden behind a button which, when clicked, executes JS code to reveal it. A competitor often calls the seller before we can. 
Concern: 
I'm aware that using Puppeteer or Playwright might slow down the process.
Possible Solution: 
Considering building a mobile app that allows the client to call immediately upon detecting a new advert.
Query: 
1. How can I optimize the advert detection process?
2. What's the best way to quickly access the phone number on a newly detected page, considering the JS button hurdle?

Unable to scrape target with BS4 and Selenium. Is it me or a curse?,"I scrape a site and now I am doomed. (Hopefully, because I'm a newbie). I want to scrape the data-score of the span in the highlighted div. (In this case ""5"")
​
How to target the data-score? (Which is 5)
I did the following in BeautifulSoup: (rating_parents is a list with all elements whit: div class = index_factor_Mo6xW
for rating in rating_parents:
            label = rating.find('h4', class_='index__title__Rq0Po')
            test = rating.find_next('div', class_='index__block__7hodp')
            print(label.text)
            if test is not None:
                #data_score = test.get('data-score')
                data_score = test.find('span', class_='index__stars__nfK6S')
                print(data_score.get('data-score'))
            else:
                print('none')

This produces this result:
Es geht immer besser aber auch deutlich schlechter #print(rating_title)
Work-Life-Balance # print(label.text)
4 #data-score print(data_score.get('data-score')
Karriere/Weiterbildung
4 #print(data_score.get('data-score'))
Why is it 4 and not 5 as in the DOM (image above) ?
A friend of mine said: Yeah, its dynamically loaded with JS. 
Both of us started trying to get the data-scores with selenium (which we are even newer to than to bs4) and used the xPath instead of HTML. When targeting the element (the span) directly with the xPath the object is not found. (Unable to locate element) 
This is the xPath:
/html/body/div[3]/div/div[1]/main/div/div[4]/div/article[2]/div/div/div[4]/div/span
I did:
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
import time

options = webdriver.FirefoxOptions()
options.add_argument(""--headless"")

options.page_load_strategy = 'none'

s = Service('./geckodriver')
driver = webdriver.Firefox(service=s, options = options)

driver.implicitly_wait(5)

url = 'https://[THE WEBSITE]'
driver.get(url)
time.sleep(20)

Because I get the unable to locate message, I wanted to check until which point the xPath works. Until this (bold):
/html/body/div[3]/div/div[1]/main/div/div[4]/div/article[2]/div/div/div[4]/div/span
The /div/span is not detected. 
The node of the bolded part in above xPath looks like 
<h4 class=""index\_\_title\_\_Rq0Po"">Work-Life-Balance</h4><p class=""index\_\_plainText\_\_JgbHE"">Some string. Some string</p> 
When doing:
html = article.get_attribute('innerHTML')
as you see, it get's pretty much all of the div – except the div inside it and so also not the span inside it. 
This part:
Why do I don't get that?
So why can't I target the data-score with Selenium? And why do I get results in BS4 which differs from what is actually going on in the DOM?
Sorry for this verbose question. I hope everything is clear and I don't miss important points. 
Thank you for your time, and me (and now my friend too) lit a candle for you, when you can enlighten us. 
Cheers,

Building a PC for scraping. Which part of hardware is important? RAM? CPU? any other parts?,"Gonna build a scraping desktop but I don't want to spend extra money on the unnecessary parts.

If RAM is important, I will buy 64gb RAM. Is 64gb enough for my use case?
If CPU is also important, what kind/level of CPU should I consider for my use case?

App for one stop shop,"Hello I have currently been looking into web scraping for various reasons. I am having a hard time finding a service that does well rounded tools.
Very simplified idea.
A for browser, phone android or Apple or application for windows and Mac.
That could plug and play.
Put In site then gives you a list of pages from the sitesmap.xml. 
With elements to select to scrape. Then goes through and makes a copy of text, video pictures etc. 
For local download with automated or manual file conversion of video, pics or text into various formats.
Also be able to copy the entire layout of the webpage to then view on the app offline.
Virtually no coding just plug and play and select what you want. I think everybody gets the idea of a one stop shop tool without any coding. 
Also will be able to monitor social media accounts to scrape things as they come. Also gather data from discord, telegram etc. 
Does something like that exist?
If it doesn’t I am considering building it myself. Current software engineer (mostly backend) I have worked on some big applications with fang so I have the experience in the entire tech stack. 
Was considering using flutter to make it easy for an app. Then use Java for backend (most of my experience). Also I say app so the hardware is your local with minimum backend work to just feed new IP’s. Will help keep cost low. Also features that come to mind having it local would give the user more freedom.
Don’t want to waste my time making it if there is a tool that does pretty much that. I’ve searched just can’t find anything that makes it simplified with no code. If anything copy paste.
I’m new in the sense of researching web scraping to do something with it. So please excuse my ignorance if I left out any info that would be a hold up etc.
If I made this do you think enough people would want the same thing? Any problems people wish were solved with tools? Could give me an idea of problems I may run into to avoid. Considering making it open source.",1,2023-10-13 19:16:07

Raven: Proxy Lister and Tester,"So i was working on this personal project, and encountred this problem; I needed a massive list of proxies for scrapping, obviously public so i will manage the rotations, and found a couple of good lists on github, but the process got tedious and tiring especially when i had to test the proxies against the custom target websites i was working on so i created this tool: Raven.
Raven is a proxy lister and tester that could get all the proxies you need for you(obviously public ones),
for now it gets only HTTP proxies, and it could test the proxies for you on custom targets of your choice. It is multithreaded so it could get through 6K proxies in around 1 to 2 mins.
It is open source and i will keep working on it, since i am still working on the main project.
You can both use it as a library in your code, or as a docker image as a fast tool with various flags.

Maybe you guys can help me. I want to scrape google for all newly openend restaurants in Berlin every 2 weeks. It's about 30 new openenings. All I need is actually the name of the restaurant and the adress. 
Which tool would you recommend? 
We could scrap on google maps or google business page I assume.
I do not need a CSV or anything fancy to evaluate the results. 
Really appreciate your help. If anyone is based in Berlin I would buy the first round of beers ;)",0,2023-10-12 11:27:21
"Remaining undetected, no proxies.","I scrape and automate on a site that requires a user's SSN to create an account, and to log in to use, so  I assume that using proxies or changing the header won't help me (if I'm wrong about this, please let me know).  This is a significant source of income for me, and if I get banned, it's over.  I've already received a warning for breaking the site rules in a different way (unrelated to botting).  I've used the community discord bot to check and they pretty much have no anti bot technology implemented.  The site has hundreds of thousands of users, but they don't seem to try to prevent it from crashing or malfunctioning during peak usage days.   How long should I wait before refreshing for real time updates?  I currently have my bot wait anywhere from 5 seconds to 1 minute, depending on if it's currently a high or low traffic period of the day.  I've been botting on the site for about a month so far, and haven't been caught, but I'm still nervous, especially since I want to reach out to other users of the site to sell my bot.  Are there any dead giveaways that I should avoid doing? Like if I access a dropdown before the entire page loads?  I can code bots just fine, but I'm still new to any theory related to this.  I want to know if there's a general rule of thumb or a more specific way of remaining undetected.  I'm using Python Selenium Chromedriver, if that helps.",2,2023-10-12 06:40:54

QUESTION: Non technical doofus seeks help scraping,"Hello! 
New to web scraping so have zero idea what I'm doing. 
Wondering if there is a tool that can help me with what I want to accomplish. 
I need to scalably search a bunch (100s) of online resumes searching for two specific keyphrases. All resumes that have one or both of the keyphrases need to be saved (by clicking 'save to favorites')...you can only navigate these resumes 1x1. So in order to progress from one resume to the next you have to manually click 'next'. 
So:
Scan resume for keywords.
Moving on to the next resume (single click) if no keywords are present. 
Saving the resume to my account (single click) if the keywords ARE present. 
Are there any ai/robot tools that can help with this?
THANKS!

Target website banned my entire pool of IPs?,"Hi,
I was having a lot of succeess against this taget website. I believe my IP rotated about 300 times. So I used roughly 300 different IP addresses. After a few hours however, it seems the entire pool of IP addresses has been banned. I ran some tests to check it's the IP pool and not user agent or something like that and it's definitely the pool.
My question is, how can they ban my entire pool of IPs when I haven't used many? The IP pool has 50k IPs (datacenter) I only used 300. This target website is very lowkey, not targeted by webscrapers or whatever. So it's unlikely these IPs were banned prior to me using them.

Scrape and download multiple PDF files from ASPX page,"Hey. New to scraping and using browser web tools, sorry for any wrong assumptions.  
Context: every year the agency who handles our apartment building gives us access to the original receipts for maintenance, cleaning, utilities costs etc. in PDF form through their website. The files can be accessed from their main website with a set of credentials, this leads to an ASPX page where we can manually download the PDFs.
Problem is, there are more than 200+ PDFs and manually clicking on each of them is a tedious task. I like to think this is evil design on their part to make tenant's lives (even more) miserable, but I digress.
I've inspected the page with a browser dev tools and managed to find the javascript calls for all the PDFs. They look like:
javascript:__doPostBack('xxx','xxx.pdf');
javascript:__doPostBack('xxx','yyy.pdf');
javascript:__doPostBack('xxx','zzz.pdf');
If I run these in console one by one, I do get the PDF file.

Puppeteer cookie expiration problem,"I'm using Puppeteer to extract data from a website that requires login, and the scraping process is generally successful. However, there's a complication involving a cookie that expires every 30 minutes. This expiration time gets refreshed whenever the page undergoes a change. The issue I'm encountering is that in a regular web browser, this updated expiration time functions as expected. However, in Puppeteer, it doesn't seem to work as intended. After 30 minutes, the website logs me out and displays a ""session expired"" message.
I've attempted various solutions to address this problem. I've tried using incognito mode, engaging in different activities on the website, saving the cookie every 10 minutes and reapplying it, and even closing and reopening the page with the saved cookie.

web crawling & scraping to find businesses,"Hello,
I am trying to do some research by finding all businesses that I can within certain demographics. Without going into too much detail, I know that there are around 50k of these businesses in the USA that are registered (census data shows this) , and probably thousands more that are small businesses on Instagram and etsy, but wouldnt be registered businesses.  I am looking to find as many of these businesses as possible through different search terms.
I am new to this, and am not exactly sure how and if this will be possible, but I have worked with some developers in the past, and it seems like it is something that could be done.  In essence, I want to be able to crawl/scrape certain websites to find these businesses and as much pertinent information about them.

From some of my research, I know that these sites can be hard to crawl.

How I develop a Google Maps Scraping Bot? Please READ full article if you are interested.,"Creating a Google Maps scraping software isn't a simple task. Big websites like Facebook, Instagram, Google Maps, and TikTok invest heavily in security to protect their data. They use advanced techniques to hide their source code from users who try to access a website's HTML. Understandably, they don't want their data to be easily accessible to the public.
So, how did I develop a method to scrape data from Google Maps? It took me many months to figure out an approach. I decided to use a screenshot-based scraping technique. My main goal was to scrape Google Maps, so here's what I did: I downloaded the source code of a Google Maps webpage and extracted the data in HTML format using the BeautifulSoup HTML parser. In simple terms, I automated the process of copying and pasting code from a webpage using the inspect element tool to extract the relevant information.
This approach turned out to be fantastic and opened up opportunities to build web scrapers on a large scale. Now, using this technique, I can extract information from almost any website on the Internet because web servers can't hide their source code when you use the inspect element tool. I've had a good laugh at many developers who struggle to extract information from websites by other means and waste time and money on expensive APIs that often yield unreliable results.
However, there's one major drawback to this approach. If Google were to disable the ability to inspect HTML code on Google Maps, my application would stop working in an instant. I hope they never do this, but if they do, I'll have to find another way to scrape data.",0,2023-10-06 11:06:56

Security through inefficiency [Rant/Funny Story],"So I've spent about a week trying to figure out how to scrape this website.  At first the issue was getting around cloudflare bot detection, eventually found an article that mentioned bypassing it completely, so now I'm sending my requests directly to the webserver and that fixed that.
I have about 500 pages I'm trying to scrape, each response takes about 3 seconds. At first I was sending a request, waiting for a response, then sending the next.  This would have taken about 25 minutes, although after 100 requests I started getting ""Too many request errors"" so it would probably take longer.
Plus, 25 minutes is already more than I'd like.  So I figured, send all the requests at once. (Using proxies to avoid ""too many requests"")  This is a pretty popular app, I figure they can handle 500 requests.
Welp, turns out their app is popular but their website must not be because it completely DDoS'd the website.  Not great.
So I figured, send requests in batches, with slight delays between each request, and a larger delay between batches.
This is when I realized what's was happening with this website.  If I sent a batch of 10 requests (which took 25 seconds for all responses to come through), and then went to their website and tried to load the page manually, the page would take 25 seconds to load.
This website is handling each request sequentially, and each request takes, at minimum, 1.5 seconds.  On average it's closer to 2.5.
Their backend must also be awful because 1 request takes 3 seconds, 5 requests takes 6 seconds, but 10 requests takes 25 seconds.

So I currently have a project where I gathered a list of 40k unique homepage URLs for an industry (doctor offices). I have been trying to work on getting the team pages of these businesses (I have already scrapped the homepage) using python. 
The issue is that I cannot get a consistent use case for extracting the team pages URLs, since the urls extension can look anything from /team to /about/team, and even /meet-our-staff etc added onto the end of the base homepage url .
I’m trying to find a way to get at least 70% of the team URLs pages.
I’ve used BeautifulSoup to:

Trying different variations of the homepages + different  forward slash extension strings of what a team url could have. And when I get a 200 code to then append that url to a new team_lst (this has the issue of appending any page even if it does not have the team info)
Grab all the href out of the webpage, this has worked the best, but some href values only have the /team or /team/about. Not the entire url of the team page.

I’ve also tried selenium and see if I can use a bot to try a list of words the team/staff button could have. But with them being nested sometimes and all unique pages, it is proving difficult.
I think the biggest challenge of course is the uniqueness of small business html tree structures.
I have some code I plan to use to scrap all text on the page into a single long string and use Regex to parse out what I need. The challenge is getting the actual team url. 
Any ideas would be super helpful, Im wondering if there are different approaches I could take or if someone has had the same issue.",1,2023-09-30 18:34:54
"Is it possible to make a web scraper that collects 1,000 Instagram accounts a day with a certain amount of followers and a certain gender?","I got a boring job requiring me to find 1000 Instagram accounts with a certain number of followers and a certain gender then copy and paste the URL to a Google spreadsheet. the job takes at least 9 hours a day. I know it can be automated I just don't know how to automate it.

go to Instagram
look at profile
if profile follow count ==  or less than ""x""  and profile gender == ""x"" then copy profile URL and paste in google spreadsheet
if profile has ""xxxx"" written in bio and if profile follower count greater then ""x"" do not copy

Scraping linkedin,"Hello, I am a master's student planning to do some scraping of linkedin for a research project with a professor. We have done a bit of work together previously scraping Craigslist which was a breeze. We are aiming to pull profiles from people in data science and data analyst roles and do some analysis on career paths, skills listed, language in describing past jobs etc.
I put together a selenium script that can do what I need once logged in, but I am concerned that managing logins, dealing with captcha, email verification, account and IP bans will be a pretty serious task if I want to scrape at a larger scale. I'd be hoping to scrape ~10k profiles if I can.
If anyone has experience scraping LinkedIn recently, I'd love to chat with them. Let me describe my current plan that I am hoping to refine and improve alot before I try to execute.

Manual account creation using residential IPs, I might create ~20-50 accounts manually. I don't know if it is worth trying to automate this step given the captchas and verification steps.
Login via proxy servers, using selenium, along with grabbing email verification code in an automated way. Probably retrying repeatedly if I get asked to solve captcha.
Scrape ~50-100 profiles, using a search, and using selenium to simply click the download profile pdf for later analysis.
Rotate to a different proxy+account and repeat.

So far while testing and developing I manually created a dummy account, scraped a couple profiles via selenium, and got it banned perhaps due to suspicious behavior with login attempts.
Any feedback and recommendations are welcome. I noticed a rule said avoid references to paid services and tooling. If this is kosher I'd personally be open to discussion of such tools although I'd prefer a free from scratch solution.",4,2023-09-28 06:17:27

Questions about the legality of using a SPA's public API,"Hi guys,
I'm a web scraping newb. I'm not sure if this is precisely web scraping related, but I figured you guys would know more about this since web scraping encounters this sort of thing.
A website is an SPA so I could use a headless browser, but I found in the network tab an API that's used to fetch the data. There is an API key for the API and if I remove the API key from the request I get denied access, so the API is NOT for everyone's use, but the website is.
Would it be against the rules to use the API with their API key? They let people use their site which uses the API anyway. If I use the API directly I wouldn't have to waste more of their resources by loading all the other things like the front-end.
Let's say I have a list of 3 Million strings and I want to use the API for all 3 million strings would that be a bad idea?
It seems like it's a gov't site with public data. Would that make a difference?
Thank you!

Would an easier way to scrape 100s of websites be useful to you?,"In the process of building AI agents, we've found that what we built could eventually be good at dynamically scraping data across a variety of websites (10s to 100s of different sites at a time)
Our understanding is that existing web scraping tools are bad at this because you need to write custom scraping configurations per site. Not only that, but when a site changes styling, it might completely break your automation. With agents however, you can provide a high level natural language overview of the data you'd like from a website or class of websites, and the agent system will deal with the details of traversing a page and fetching data automatically.
We’re curious how useful this might be for people. If you’ve experienced issues that this might solve or have already explored the space, I'd love to hear from you!",8,2023-09-22 20:33:06

Advice on Automating My eBay Business Using ActivePieces and Web scraping.,"Hello fellow Redditors,
I'm reaching out for guidance on how to harness the power of automation tools like ActivePieces (similar to Zapier) and web bots for scraping to optimize my eBay business. I'm brand new to computer automation and eager to explore its potential.
About My Business:
 I run an eBay business where I sell branded items and flip collectible video games and trading cards. 
I have a vision to scale up my business in the realm of collectibles with the assistance of automation.
My Automation Ideas:
Automation 1: I'm thinking of using a web scraper to search eBay and other platforms for undervalued items. The scraped data would be sent to a spreadsheet, where I've set up formulas to determine whether I should make a purchase. For instance, if an item typically sells for $100 and I need to buy it at $70 to make a profit, I want to scrape and highlight listings that fit this criteria for further review.
Automation 2: Another idea is to scrape sales data for specific items, including their selling price and frequency of sales. This data can help me decide which items to target in Automation 1. Imagine having a list of 100 items, and the automation tool goes to eBay, fetches the sales data for each item over the last 90 days, and organizes it in a new spreadsheet.
Automation 3: Lastly, I'm considering a more creative use of automation, such as taking an item's name or SKU, gathering product images, and sending them to Canva to generate updated images using prebuilt templates. This would be a time-saver, but I'm still working out the details.
I would greatly appreciate any advice, insights, automations you think would help or even potential tutorials if someone is willing to guide me through the basics of using these automation tools. Additionally, I'm more than willing to share my knowledge and experiences with others in my eBay business. Thank you in advance for your help and support.",3,2023-09-19 18:42:06

The script works fine when I try to run it from my local computer, but I want to be able to run it from my websites hosted server on A2Hosting.com
I spoke to customer support with Smart Proxy and they said it’s not an issue on their end, and it’s not an issue with my code. So it looks like it’s some kind of issue with my web hosting provider. I submitted a ticket with my webhosting provider, but am a bit anxious to find a solution here.
I was using php to crawl sites because I wanted to have it scheduled to auto run as a crown job, so I didn’t want to do a Python script or anything because I can’t do Python from jobs with my web hosting provider.
Anyways, I know this is vague, but if you’ve ever encountered any similar kind of issue I’d appreciate your feedback!",1,2023-09-17 02:14:45
Searching for quantity of stock still available when it is not written in the html,"As from title, I am searching for the quantity still in stock for products in a site.
Unfortunately, I've searched for it and it is not written anywhere in the html.
Since I'm a beginner I was wondering if there are other ways to search for it.

Scraping data from McDonald's,"I'd like to compose a list of all McDonald's restaurants in certain European countries.
Many countries (eg. the UK, Netherlands, Switzerland) use a common API which delivers the results as a JSON array:
https://www.mcdonalds.com/googleappsv2/geolocation?latitude=51.54&longitude=-0.15&radius=200&maxResults=150&country=gb&language=en-gb
https://www.mcdonalds.com/googleappsv2/geolocation?latitude=52.55&longitude=5.60&radius=200&maxResults=150&country=nl&language=en-nl
https://www.mcdonalds.com/googleappsv2/geolocation?latitude=46.20&longitude=6.14&radius=200&maxResults=150&country=ch&language=en-ch
The parameters should be quite self-explanatory.
But the API seems to have a upper limit regarding the ""maxResults"" parameters depending on the ""country"" parameter. While the GB call returns 150 results, the NL call only returns a subset of 38.  
It seems to be a Google API. IS there any known way to bypass this behaviour?
At the moment I bypass this limitation by setting the maxresults to a low number, changing the latitude and longitude parameters by a slight margin and calling the API again and again eliminating double results afterwards. But I'm worried that I might miss results in dense areas like London or Amsterdam.  
Any ideas or suggestions?",1,2023-09-16 15:35:05
Need help with scraping Blinkit,I need to scrape Blinkit grocery data from https://www.blinkit.com. The catch is that I need the same grocery data from different area pincodes.

How to deal with CloudFlare human verification when using Selenium?,"Hello, I am very new to web automation, and as a fun project decided I would automate the process that I upload some stuff to redBubble. I am still learning how to deal with captchas, and right now I just give myself time to manually intervene and solve the puzzles as they pop up, however on this site, particularly when I go to upload a new work, it just gives me the checkbox saying 'Checking if the site connection is secure' and when I click it, it just has a small loading animation then pops up again.
​
looks like this
I have tried a lot of research on google and reddit for solutions, I have tried using undetected chrome, I have tried copying some selenium driver options that were recommended (not that I understand them), I even take time in my script to go to https://cloudflare.manfredi.io/en/tools/connection to check if my connection looks like a bots and it doesn't there, furthermore I have many randomized time sleeps and move the mouse myself while it runs, so idk why it thinks I am a bot. I assume it is something innate about the browser Selenium opens, as when I do this manually on chrome (what I normally use to surf internet) I get no such check.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I've been stuck for ages on this.",3,2023-09-13 03:40:30

Challenge Pages on Indeed,"Hello,
I am practicing scraping without a headless browser controller. I am trying to use Axios to grab the DOM from a request URL. The problem is, I am returned a Cloudflare challenge page that contains nothing but a bunch of obfuscated Javascript. I don't get this page when visiting the page as a human. I am only making one request and I got it on my first ever request so I am not being limited or anything. Aside from setting my request headers to match my browser, I honestly don't know what else to try. Has anyone dealt with anything similar?

Scraper Race! Puppeteer JS vs Playwright Python vs Selenium Python,"Hey Everyone, I ran a [rather silly] race between Puppeteer, Playwright and Selenium to see which one would be fastest on a simple scrape.
Far from a comprehensive benchmark, this race is 100% free from advanced configurations, multi-threading or anything complicated. It just opens Wallapop (a second hand marketplace in Spain) and times how long it takes to extract the first 2000 results of a search.
Another thing to note is that I ran this on Google Colab, that throttles resources unpredictably, so take this as it is, just a simple-fun race with lots of questionable decisions.
If you like this simple format, have any ideas on how to improve a race like this or have a strong urge to prove Ward Cunningham wright, let me know in the comments!
(Also, if you think your tool of choice isn't being represented fairly, feel free show how simple code improvements yield more speed with the same resources :)",7,2023-09-11 09:22:29

How do you compare apples to apples scrapping tools/packages?,"Hi all,
I work for a large financial data company.  Specifically for our product, we scrape newswires and general financial announcements from the web which we take in and enrich our data.  We come across multiple different tools that help with annotating & scrapping such sites.  Most if not all are semi blackbox where it's one model applying to any and all doc/url/sites we submit.  This requires tagging which leads to training which may and may not improve quality/accuracy.  But this is very manual and time consuming.  We get demos from internal Data/data science teams, external vendors etc who all try to pitch.  Basic questions to these operations always lead to tagging/training but typically of one model for all which we find usually wont work (there's no silver bullet that can work for all variations/examples etc).  
We built up an internal team that work primarily with Python and the differ packages to create our own models but break up the use cases (sources/urls/pdfs) to groups that are similar in nature and create a custom solution for each scenario to increase the accuracy and reduce the training.  This is especially true for structured data.
My question for the group.  I want to be able to assess and compare such tools as they come along in an apples to apples way.  What I was thinking was to create some test cases (excel file of URLs/PDFs etc with their expected output) for a set of structured data (maybe 1K sample) + semi structured + unstructured.  and run such datasets against the tools as a baseline comparison.  This can be different applications, or new tools like ChatGBT or  Bart etc.  While this will only give me Non-tagging/training results, it at least gives a base line.  Maybe I can add  say ""after 100 tags, here are the results"" and compare again.  What do you guys think would be a good approach to measure/compare apples to apples scraping tools/packages on structured/semi/unstructured data/docs?

Scraping LinkedIn for jobs,"Just finished this, maybe will be useful for some: https://github.com/cwwmbm/linkedinscraper.

What is it? Python script scraping LinkedIn for jobs and stores them into database. config.json is where all the setup and parameters are being set. There's also a web interface to launch on local machine so you can browse them. Screenshot: https://github.com/cwwmbm/linkedinscraper/blob/main/screenshot/screenshot.png
Why is it? Because LinkedIn is the worst website in the world and the less I go there the lower my blood pressure will be. Everything about it is annoying. Everything. Also, I needed a project.
Important notes:


It scrapes jobs synchronously, so it takes a bit of time. I couldn't make asynchronous sync work; tried several libraries and for all LinkedIn refused connection. First launch is the longest because the database is empty, so it'll scrape everything it finds (within the parameters you set). I did 10 queries, it took about 15 minutes. All subsequent launches will be much quicker because it won't scrape jobs that are already in the database.
It's in the readme but it bears repeating: if you are using this application, please be aware that LinkedIn does not allow scraping of its website. Use this application at your own risk. It's recommended to use proxy servers to avoid getting blocked by LinkedIn. If you do not use proxy it's extremely likely your IP will be blocked very quickly. I use paid residential proxies to do this. It costs less than a coffee for a lot of mileage.

What 
FAQ:

Why is web interface so basic? Your mom is basic. But also, I never ever programmed web interface in my life. This is the first time I created html file. If you think you can do better please be my guest.
I tried to run it and it shows an error, can you please help me? Use ChatGPT to help you debug. If I could make it write web interface for this you can make it debug it for you. I believe in you.
What problem this addresses, specifically?


LinkedIn can't just show recent jobs, they will be peppered with sponsored postings.
LinkedIn makes decisions what's relevant to you and what not based on internal algorithm written by someone who hates humanity
LinkedIn will show you same jobs that you saw for months without showing you anything new
LinkedIn will show you jobs completely irrelevant to you that only have in common one common word in the description. 
My current job recommendations on LinkedIn are: a 6 month old job, a construction job (I'm in software), a job in Phoenix, AZ (I'm in Canada), and two software jobs that have nothing to do with me at all.
Last week I was shown a job for the first time - it was two weeks old, it was very relevant to me, and it was 2 weeks too late to do anything about because they had over 200 applicants and stopped taking applications. I had similar experiences almost every month.
LinkedIn is a product that's written by people who don't use it. So it's understandable that it sucks donkey dicks, but it also got the monopoly on job postings where I am so I got no choice.
LinkedIn is a stupid name
It's also a stupid concept
I hate it
Fuck LinkedIn.",27,2023-06-08 05:01:42
